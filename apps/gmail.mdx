## üìî Documentation

- [OAuth Documentation](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/auth/scopes)
- [API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

<Tip>The Gmail API needs to be enabled in the [Enabled APIs and Services section](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?) on the Google Console Dashboard and the OAuth 2.0 Client ID can be obtained from the [Credentials section](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?).</Tip>

Once you create the OAuth Client ID, please configure the below Redirect URL in the _Authorised redirect URIs_
section:


```
https://backend.composio.dev/api/v1/auth-apps/add
```

After creating the app, copy the Client ID and Secret from Additional Information section in the Client ID Page. On Composio's [Integrations](https://app.composio.dev/apps) page, find Gmail and add a new integration. Paste your Client ID and Secret, then save to connect Gmail.
