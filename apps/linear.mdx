> Linear uses OAuth2 for authentication.

## 📔 Documentation

1. [Linear API Documentation](https://developers.linear.app/docs/api/linear-api)
2. [Linear OAuth Documentation](https://developers.linear.app/docs/oauth/overview)

## ⚙️ Configuration

<Tip>
To use OAuth2 with Linear, you'll need to create an OAuth application in your Linear settings.
</Tip>

Once you have created your OAuth application in Linear, go to the "OAuth & Permissions" section to configure your Redirect URL:

```
https://backend.composio.dev/api/v1/auth-apps/github/connection/oauth2/add
```
After configuring the Redirect URL, you will be given a Client ID and Client Secret. Keep these credentials secure, as you will use them to authenticate with Linear. On Composio's [supported apps](https://app.composio.dev/apps) page, find Linear and click "Enable". Enter your Client ID and Client Secret, then Save to connect Linear.
