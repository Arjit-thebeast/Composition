## Connecting CrewAI with Accelo

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Accelo

A system to boost productivity and profitability across your service business.

### Integrating Accelo with CrewAI

Integrating Accelo & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. tracking time for projects and tasks
2. managing client relationships efficiently
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Accelo

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Accelo App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Accelo
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add accelo # One line to authenticate, configure and add Accelo integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions accelo "tracking time for projects and tasks" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Accelo CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Accelo
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Accelo
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ACCELO]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Accelo API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "tracking time for projects and tasks"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Accelo Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Accelo using Accelo APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Accelo on users behalf. You need to take action on Accelo using Accelo APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_accelo = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.ACCELO_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_accelo = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ACCELO])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_accelo = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ACCELO], tags=[Tag.ACCELO_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
