## Connecting CrewAI with aero-workflow

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of aero-workflow

Workflow designed for accountants by accountants. Aero gives you the tools you need to run your firm proactively, creating a scalable, efficient firm.

### Integrating aero-workflow with CrewAI

Integrating aero-workflow & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. managing client tasks efficiently
2. automating repetitive accounting processes
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with aero-workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the aero-workflow App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising aero-workflow
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add aero-workflow # One line to authenticate, configure and add aero-workflow integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions aero-workflow "managing client tasks efficiently" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all aero-workflow CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For aero-workflow
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for aero-workflow
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.AERO-WORKFLOW]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform aero-workflow API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "managing client tasks efficiently"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='aero-workflow Agent',
    goal="""You take action on aero-workflow using aero-workflow APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on aero-workflow on users behalf. You need to take action on aero-workflow using aero-workflow APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_aero-workflow = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.AERO-WORKFLOW_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_aero-workflow = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.AERO-WORKFLOW])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_aero-workflow = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.AERO-WORKFLOW], tags=[Tag.AERO-WORKFLOW_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
