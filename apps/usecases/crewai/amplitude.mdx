## Connecting CrewAI with Amplitude

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Amplitude

Amplitude Inc. is an American publicly trading company that develops digital analytics software.

### Integrating Amplitude with CrewAI

Integrating Amplitude & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Tracking user behavior in digital products
2. Analyzing product usage to improve user experience
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Amplitude

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Amplitude App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Amplitude
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add amplitude # One line to authenticate, configure and add Amplitude integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions amplitude "Tracking user behavior in digital products" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Amplitude CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Amplitude
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Amplitude
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.AMPLITUDE]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Amplitude API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Tracking user behavior in digital products"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Amplitude Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Amplitude using Amplitude APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Amplitude on users behalf. You need to take action on Amplitude using Amplitude APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_amplitude = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.AMPLITUDE_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_amplitude = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.AMPLITUDE])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_amplitude = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.AMPLITUDE], tags=[Tag.AMPLITUDE_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
