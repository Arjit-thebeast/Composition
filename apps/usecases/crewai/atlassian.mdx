## Connecting CrewAI with Atlassian

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Atlassian

Integrate with Atlassian Cloud products to enhance development tools and collaboration.

### Integrating Atlassian with CrewAI

Integrating Atlassian & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Tracking project progress in Jira
2. Automating CI/CD workflows with Bitbucket
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Atlassian

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Atlassian App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Atlassian
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add atlassian # One line to authenticate, configure and add Atlassian integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions atlassian "Tracking project progress in Jira" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Atlassian CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Atlassian
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Atlassian
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ATLASSIAN]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Atlassian API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Tracking project progress in Jira"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Atlassian Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Atlassian using Atlassian APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Atlassian on users behalf. You need to take action on Atlassian using Atlassian APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_atlassian = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.ATLASSIAN_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_atlassian = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ATLASSIAN])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_atlassian = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ATLASSIAN], tags=[Tag.ATLASSIAN_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
