## Connecting CrewAI with Auth0

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Auth0

Auth0 is a platform that allows developers and companies to verify a user's identity before giving them access to applications and websites.

### Integrating Auth0 with CrewAI

Integrating Auth0 & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. User Authentication
2. Creating secure login flows
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Auth0

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Auth0 App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Auth0
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add auth0 # One line to authenticate, configure and add Auth0 integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions auth0 "User Authentication" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Auth0 CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Auth0
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Auth0
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.AUTH0]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Auth0 API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "User Authentication"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Auth0 Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Auth0 using Auth0 APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Auth0 on users behalf. You need to take action on Auth0 using Auth0 APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_auth0 = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.AUTH0_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_auth0 = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.AUTH0])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_auth0 = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.AUTH0], tags=[Tag.AUTH0_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
