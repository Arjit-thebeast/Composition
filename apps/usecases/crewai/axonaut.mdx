## Connecting CrewAI with Axonaut

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Axonaut

Axonaut, the management software for  VSEs and SMEs

### Integrating Axonaut with CrewAI

Integrating Axonaut & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. CRM for tracking customer interactions
2. Managing invoices and expenses
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Axonaut

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Axonaut App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Axonaut
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add axonaut # One line to authenticate, configure and add Axonaut integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions axonaut "CRM for tracking customer interactions" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Axonaut CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Axonaut
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Axonaut
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.AXONAUT]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Axonaut API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "CRM for tracking customer interactions"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Axonaut Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Axonaut using Axonaut APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Axonaut on users behalf. You need to take action on Axonaut using Axonaut APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_axonaut = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.AXONAUT_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_axonaut = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.AXONAUT])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_axonaut = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.AXONAUT], tags=[Tag.AXONAUT_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
