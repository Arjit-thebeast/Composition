## Connecting CrewAI with Bannerbear

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Bannerbear

Bannerbear is an API and integration tool that allows users to auto-generate social media visuals, e-commerce banners, and more.

### Integrating Bannerbear with CrewAI

Integrating Bannerbear & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. auto-generate social media visuals
2. create e-commerce banners
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Bannerbear

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Bannerbear App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Bannerbear
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add bannerbear # One line to authenticate, configure and add Bannerbear integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions bannerbear "auto-generate social media visuals" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Bannerbear CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Bannerbear
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Bannerbear
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.BANNERBEAR]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Bannerbear API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "auto-generate social media visuals"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Bannerbear Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Bannerbear using Bannerbear APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Bannerbear on users behalf. You need to take action on Bannerbear using Bannerbear APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_bannerbear = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.BANNERBEAR_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_bannerbear = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.BANNERBEAR])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_bannerbear = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.BANNERBEAR], tags=[Tag.BANNERBEAR_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
