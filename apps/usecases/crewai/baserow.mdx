## Connecting CrewAI with Baserow

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Baserow

Access and manage your Baserow databases programmatically.

### Integrating Baserow with CrewAI

Integrating Baserow & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Storing and managing data in Baserow tables
2. Creating custom workflows using Baserow API
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Baserow

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Baserow App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Baserow
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add baserow # One line to authenticate, configure and add Baserow integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions baserow "Storing and managing data in Baserow tables" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Baserow CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Baserow
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Baserow
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.BASEROW]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Baserow API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Storing and managing data in Baserow tables"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Baserow Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Baserow using Baserow APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Baserow on users behalf. You need to take action on Baserow using Baserow APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_baserow = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.BASEROW_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_baserow = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.BASEROW])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_baserow = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.BASEROW], tags=[Tag.BASEROW_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
