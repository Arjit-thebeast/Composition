## Connecting CrewAI with BoldSign

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of BoldSign

BoldSign is an easy-to-use and secure electronic signature solution. With BoldSign you can quickly complete your contracts, accept offers, sign NDAs, approve invoices, confirm service appointments, onboard new employees, and more with just few clicks.

### Integrating BoldSign with CrewAI

Integrating BoldSign & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. signing contracts and NDAs
2. onboarding new employees
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with BoldSign

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the BoldSign App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising BoldSign
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add boldsign # One line to authenticate, configure and add BoldSign integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions boldsign "signing contracts and NDAs" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all BoldSign CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For BoldSign
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for BoldSign
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.BOLDSIGN]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform BoldSign API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "signing contracts and NDAs"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='BoldSign Agent',
    goal="""You take action on BoldSign using BoldSign APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on BoldSign on users behalf. You need to take action on BoldSign using BoldSign APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_boldsign = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.BOLDSIGN_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_boldsign = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.BOLDSIGN])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_boldsign = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.BOLDSIGN], tags=[Tag.BOLDSIGN_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
