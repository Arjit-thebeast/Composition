## Connecting CrewAI with Browse.ai
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Browse.ai

Browse.ai allows you to turn any website into an API using its advanced web automation and data extraction tools, enabling easy monitoring and data retrieval from websites.

### Integrating Browse.ai with CrewAI

Integrating Browse.ai & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Extracting data from dynamic websites
2. Automating web interactions
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Browse.ai
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Browse.ai App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Browse.ai
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add browseai # One line to authenticate, configure and add Browse.ai integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions browseai "Extracting data from dynamic websites" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Browse.ai CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Browse.ai
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Browse.ai
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.BROWSEAI]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Browse.ai API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Extracting data from dynamic websites"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Browse.ai Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Browse.ai using Browse.ai APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Browse.ai on users behalf. You need to take action on Browse.ai using Browse.ai APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_browseai = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.BROWSEAI_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_browseai = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.BROWSEAI])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_browseai = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.BROWSEAI], tags=[Tag.BROWSEAI_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
