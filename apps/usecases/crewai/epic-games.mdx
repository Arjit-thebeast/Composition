## Connecting CrewAI with Epic Games

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Epic Games

Epic Games integration for OAuth2 authentication.

### Integrating Epic Games with CrewAI

Integrating Epic Games & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Authenticating users via OAuth2
2. Fetching user profile data after authentication
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Epic Games

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Epic Games App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Epic Games
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add epic-games # One line to authenticate, configure and add Epic Games integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions epic-games "Authenticating users via OAuth2" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Epic Games CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Epic Games
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Epic Games
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.EPIC-GAMES]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Epic Games API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Authenticating users via OAuth2"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Epic Games Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Epic Games using Epic Games APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Epic Games on users behalf. You need to take action on Epic Games using Epic Games APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_epic-games = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.EPIC-GAMES_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_epic-games = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.EPIC-GAMES])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_epic-games = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.EPIC-GAMES], tags=[Tag.EPIC-GAMES_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
