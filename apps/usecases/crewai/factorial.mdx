## Connecting CrewAI with factorial
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of factorial

It is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and manage various HR processes within an organization.

### Integrating factorial with CrewAI

Integrating factorial & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Managing employee records
2. Automating payroll processing
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with factorial
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the factorial App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising factorial
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add factorial # One line to authenticate, configure and add factorial integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions factorial "Managing employee records" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all factorial CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For factorial
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for factorial
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.FACTORIAL]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform factorial API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Managing employee records"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='factorial Agent',
    goal="""You take action on factorial using factorial APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on factorial on users behalf. You need to take action on factorial using factorial APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_factorial = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.FACTORIAL_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_factorial = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.FACTORIAL])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_factorial = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.FACTORIAL], tags=[Tag.FACTORIAL_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
