## Connecting CrewAI with FreshBooks
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of FreshBooks

Accounting software that makes running your small business easy, fast and secure.

### Integrating FreshBooks with CrewAI

Integrating FreshBooks & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Simplifying invoicing
2. Tracking expenses efficiently
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with FreshBooks
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the FreshBooks App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising FreshBooks
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add freshbooks # One line to authenticate, configure and add FreshBooks integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions freshbooks "Simplifying invoicing" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all FreshBooks CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For FreshBooks
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for FreshBooks
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.FRESHBOOKS]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform FreshBooks API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Simplifying invoicing"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='FreshBooks Agent',
    goal="""You take action on FreshBooks using FreshBooks APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on FreshBooks on users behalf. You need to take action on FreshBooks using FreshBooks APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_freshbooks = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.FRESHBOOKS_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_freshbooks = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.FRESHBOOKS])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_freshbooks = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.FRESHBOOKS], tags=[Tag.FRESHBOOKS_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
