## Connecting CrewAI with Front
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Front

A customer communication hub that brings emails and messages into a single platform for better team collaboration and customer service.

### Integrating Front with CrewAI

Integrating Front & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Managing customer support tickets
2. Creating automated responses for common queries
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Front
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Front App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Front
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add front # One line to authenticate, configure and add Front integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions front "Managing customer support tickets" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Front CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Front
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Front
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.FRONT]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Front API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Managing customer support tickets"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Front Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Front using Front APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Front on users behalf. You need to take action on Front using Front APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_front = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.FRONT_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_front = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.FRONT])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_front = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.FRONT], tags=[Tag.FRONT_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
