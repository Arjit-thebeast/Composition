## Connecting CrewAI with Google Sheets

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Google Sheets

Google Sheets is a web-based spreadsheet program that is part of the Google Drive office suite.

### Integrating Google Sheets with CrewAI

Integrating Google Sheets & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Managing and analyzing data collaboratively
2. Automating data entry and synchronization
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Google Sheets

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Google Sheets App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Google Sheets
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add google-sheets # One line to authenticate, configure and add Google Sheets integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions google-sheets "Managing and analyzing data collaboratively" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Google Sheets CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Google Sheets
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Google Sheets
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.GOOGLE-SHEETS]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Google Sheets API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Managing and analyzing data collaboratively"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Google Sheets Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Google Sheets using Google Sheets APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Google Sheets on users behalf. You need to take action on Google Sheets using Google Sheets APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_google-sheets = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.GOOGLE-SHEETS_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_google-sheets = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.GOOGLE-SHEETS])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_google-sheets = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.GOOGLE-SHEETS], tags=[Tag.GOOGLE-SHEETS_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
