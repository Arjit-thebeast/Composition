## Connecting CrewAI with LastPass

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of LastPass

LastPass is a password manager that stores encrypted passwords online.

### Integrating LastPass with CrewAI

Integrating LastPass & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. storing and managing passwords securely
2. generating strong, unique passwords
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with LastPass

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the LastPass App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising LastPass
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add lastpass # One line to authenticate, configure and add LastPass integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions lastpass "storing and managing passwords securely" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all LastPass CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For LastPass
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for LastPass
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.LASTPASS]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform LastPass API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "storing and managing passwords securely"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='LastPass Agent',
    goal="""You take action on LastPass using LastPass APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on LastPass on users behalf. You need to take action on LastPass using LastPass APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_lastpass = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.LASTPASS_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_lastpass = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.LASTPASS])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_lastpass = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.LASTPASS], tags=[Tag.LASTPASS_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
