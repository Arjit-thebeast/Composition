## Connecting CrewAI with more-trees

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of more-trees

More Trees provides an API for automating tree planting services and customizing impact statistics.

### Integrating more-trees with CrewAI

Integrating more-trees & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. automating tree planting services
2. customizing impact statistics
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with more-trees

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the more-trees App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising more-trees
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add more-trees # One line to authenticate, configure and add more-trees integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions more-trees "automating tree planting services" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all more-trees CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For more-trees
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for more-trees
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.MORE-TREES]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform more-trees API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "automating tree planting services"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='more-trees Agent',
    goal="""You take action on more-trees using more-trees APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on more-trees on users behalf. You need to take action on more-trees using more-trees APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_more-trees = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.MORE-TREES_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_more-trees = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.MORE-TREES])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_more-trees = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.MORE-TREES], tags=[Tag.MORE-TREES_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
