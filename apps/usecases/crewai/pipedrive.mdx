## Connecting CrewAI with Pipedrive

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Pipedrive

Pipedrive is a web-based Sales CRM and pipeline management solution that enables businesses to plan their sales activities and monitor deals.

### Integrating Pipedrive with CrewAI

Integrating Pipedrive & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. tracking sales activities and managing pipelines
2. automating follow-up emails to potential clients
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Pipedrive

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Pipedrive App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Pipedrive
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add pipedrive # One line to authenticate, configure and add Pipedrive integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions pipedrive "tracking sales activities and managing pipelines" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Pipedrive CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Pipedrive
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Pipedrive
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.PIPEDRIVE]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Pipedrive API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "tracking sales activities and managing pipelines"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Pipedrive Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Pipedrive using Pipedrive APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Pipedrive on users behalf. You need to take action on Pipedrive using Pipedrive APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_pipedrive = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.PIPEDRIVE_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_pipedrive = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.PIPEDRIVE])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_pipedrive = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.PIPEDRIVE], tags=[Tag.PIPEDRIVE_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
