## Connecting CrewAI with Qualaroo

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Qualaroo

Qualaroo is a customer and user feedback software that allows you to gather insights from your website visitors and customers.

### Integrating Qualaroo with CrewAI

Integrating Qualaroo & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. gathering user feedback
2. creating targeted surveys
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Qualaroo

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Qualaroo App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Qualaroo
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add qualaroo # One line to authenticate, configure and add Qualaroo integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions qualaroo "gathering user feedback" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Qualaroo CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Qualaroo
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Qualaroo
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.QUALAROO]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Qualaroo API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "gathering user feedback"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Qualaroo Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Qualaroo using Qualaroo APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Qualaroo on users behalf. You need to take action on Qualaroo using Qualaroo APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_qualaroo = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.QUALAROO_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_qualaroo = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.QUALAROO])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_qualaroo = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.QUALAROO], tags=[Tag.QUALAROO_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
