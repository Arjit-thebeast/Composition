## Connecting CrewAI with Raven SEO Tools

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Raven SEO Tools

Raven SEO Tools offers advanced SEO analysis, reporting, and data tracking services, enabling marketers and SEO professionals to enhance their online visibility and marketing strategies.

### Integrating Raven SEO Tools with CrewAI

Integrating Raven SEO Tools & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. conducting detailed SEO analysis
2. generating comprehensive marketing reports
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Raven SEO Tools

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Raven SEO Tools App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Raven SEO Tools
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add ravenseotools # One line to authenticate, configure and add Raven SEO Tools integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions ravenseotools "conducting detailed SEO analysis" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Raven SEO Tools CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Raven SEO Tools
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Raven SEO Tools
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.RAVENSEOTOOLS]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Raven SEO Tools API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "conducting detailed SEO analysis"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Raven SEO Tools Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Raven SEO Tools using Raven SEO Tools APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Raven SEO Tools on users behalf. You need to take action on Raven SEO Tools using Raven SEO Tools APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_ravenseotools = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.RAVENSEOTOOLS_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_ravenseotools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.RAVENSEOTOOLS])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_ravenseotools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.RAVENSEOTOOLS], tags=[Tag.RAVENSEOTOOLS_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
