## Connecting CrewAI with ScreenshotOne
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of ScreenshotOne

ScreenshotOne API is a service that allows users to generate invoices in PDF format for any given URL or HTML, take screenshots of websites with different options, and check that the site looks as expected.

### Integrating ScreenshotOne with CrewAI

Integrating ScreenshotOne & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Taking screenshots of websites with different options
2. Generating invoices in pdf format for any given url or html
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with ScreenshotOne
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the ScreenshotOne App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising ScreenshotOne
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add screenshotone # One line to authenticate, configure and add ScreenshotOne integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions screenshotone "Taking screenshots of websites with different options" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all ScreenshotOne CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For ScreenshotOne
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for ScreenshotOne
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SCREENSHOTONE]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform ScreenshotOne API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Taking screenshots of websites with different options"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='ScreenshotOne Agent',
    goal="""You take action on ScreenshotOne using ScreenshotOne APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on ScreenshotOne on users behalf. You need to take action on ScreenshotOne using ScreenshotOne APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_screenshotone = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.SCREENSHOTONE_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_screenshotone = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SCREENSHOTONE])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_screenshotone = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SCREENSHOTONE], tags=[Tag.SCREENSHOTONE_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
