## Connecting CrewAI with SmugMug

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of SmugMug

SmugMug is a paid image sharing, image hosting service, and online video platform on which users can upload photos and videos.

### Integrating SmugMug with CrewAI

Integrating SmugMug & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Sharing high-quality images and videos
2. Creating and managing photo albums
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with SmugMug

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the SmugMug App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising SmugMug
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add smugmug # One line to authenticate, configure and add SmugMug integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions smugmug "Sharing high-quality images and videos" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all SmugMug CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For SmugMug
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for SmugMug
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SMUGMUG]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform SmugMug API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Sharing high-quality images and videos"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='SmugMug Agent',
    goal="""You take action on SmugMug using SmugMug APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on SmugMug on users behalf. You need to take action on SmugMug using SmugMug APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_smugmug = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.SMUGMUG_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_smugmug = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SMUGMUG])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_smugmug = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SMUGMUG], tags=[Tag.SMUGMUG_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
