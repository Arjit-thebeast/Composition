## Connecting CrewAI with Square
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Square

Square is a comprehensive commerce platform that offers tools for payment processing, point-of-sale, and online store management.

### Integrating Square with CrewAI

Integrating Square & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Processing payments
2. Managing online stores
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Square
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Square App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Square
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add square # One line to authenticate, configure and add Square integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions square "Processing payments" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Square CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Square
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Square
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SQUARE]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Square API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Processing payments"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Square Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Square using Square APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Square on users behalf. You need to take action on Square using Square APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_square = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.SQUARE_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_square = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SQUARE])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_square = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SQUARE], tags=[Tag.SQUARE_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
