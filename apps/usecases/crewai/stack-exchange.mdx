## Connecting CrewAI with Stack Exchange

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Stack Exchange

Stack Exchange is a network of question-and-answer websites on topics in diverse fields, each site covering a specific topic, where questions, answers, and users are subject to a reputation award process.

### Integrating Stack Exchange with CrewAI

Integrating Stack Exchange & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. asking and answering questions
2. participating in community discussions
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Stack Exchange

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Stack Exchange App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Stack Exchange
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add stack-exchange # One line to authenticate, configure and add Stack Exchange integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions stack-exchange "asking and answering questions" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Stack Exchange CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Stack Exchange
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Stack Exchange
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.STACK-EXCHANGE]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Stack Exchange API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "asking and answering questions"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Stack Exchange Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Stack Exchange using Stack Exchange APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Stack Exchange on users behalf. You need to take action on Stack Exchange using Stack Exchange APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_stack-exchange = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.STACK-EXCHANGE_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_stack-exchange = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.STACK-EXCHANGE])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_stack-exchange = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.STACK-EXCHANGE], tags=[Tag.STACK-EXCHANGE_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
