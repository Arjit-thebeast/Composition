## Connecting CrewAI with SurveyMonkey

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of SurveyMonkey

SurveyMonkey is an online survey software that helps with creating and running surveys online.

### Integrating SurveyMonkey with CrewAI

Integrating SurveyMonkey & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. creating and running surveys online
2. analyzing survey results
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with SurveyMonkey

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the SurveyMonkey App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising SurveyMonkey
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add survey-monkey # One line to authenticate, configure and add SurveyMonkey integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions survey-monkey "creating and running surveys online" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all SurveyMonkey CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For SurveyMonkey
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for SurveyMonkey
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SURVEY-MONKEY]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform SurveyMonkey API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "creating and running surveys online"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='SurveyMonkey Agent',
    goal="""You take action on SurveyMonkey using SurveyMonkey APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on SurveyMonkey on users behalf. You need to take action on SurveyMonkey using SurveyMonkey APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_survey-monkey = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.SURVEY-MONKEY_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_survey-monkey = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SURVEY-MONKEY])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_survey-monkey = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SURVEY-MONKEY], tags=[Tag.SURVEY-MONKEY_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
