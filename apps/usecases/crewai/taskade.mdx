## Connecting CrewAI with Taskade

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Taskade

Taskade is a tool for team collaboration and task management with support for real-time updates, nested task lists, and more.

### Integrating Taskade with CrewAI

Integrating Taskade & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. creating and managing nested task lists
2. setting up real-time collaborative sessions
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Taskade

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Taskade App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Taskade
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add taskade # One line to authenticate, configure and add Taskade integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions taskade "creating and managing nested task lists" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Taskade CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Taskade
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Taskade
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TASKADE]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Taskade API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "creating and managing nested task lists"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Taskade Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Taskade using Taskade APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Taskade on users behalf. You need to take action on Taskade using Taskade APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_taskade = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.TASKADE_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_taskade = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TASKADE])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_taskade = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TASKADE], tags=[Tag.TASKADE_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
