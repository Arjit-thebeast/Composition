## Connecting CrewAI with TextRazor

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of TextRazor

TextRazor offers state-of-the-art natural language processing tools, enabling advanced text analysis and understanding through their API.

### Integrating TextRazor with CrewAI

Integrating TextRazor & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. analyzing and extracting entities from text
2. performing sentiment analysis on textual data
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with TextRazor

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the TextRazor App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising TextRazor
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add textrazor # One line to authenticate, configure and add TextRazor integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions textrazor "analyzing and extracting entities from text" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all TextRazor CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For TextRazor
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for TextRazor
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TEXTRAZOR]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform TextRazor API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "analyzing and extracting entities from text"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='TextRazor Agent',
    goal="""You take action on TextRazor using TextRazor APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on TextRazor on users behalf. You need to take action on TextRazor using TextRazor APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_textrazor = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.TEXTRAZOR_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_textrazor = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TEXTRAZOR])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_textrazor = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TEXTRAZOR], tags=[Tag.TEXTRAZOR_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
