## Connecting CrewAI with Timely

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Timely

Timely is a time tracking app that helps with scheduling, hours logging, and project planning.

### Integrating Timely with CrewAI

Integrating Timely & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. logging hours for projects
2. scheduling team meetings
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Timely

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Timely App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Timely
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add timely # One line to authenticate, configure and add Timely integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions timely "logging hours for projects" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Timely CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Timely
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Timely
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TIMELY]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Timely API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "logging hours for projects"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Timely Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Timely using Timely APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Timely on users behalf. You need to take action on Timely using Timely APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_timely = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.TIMELY_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_timely = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TIMELY])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_timely = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TIMELY], tags=[Tag.TIMELY_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
