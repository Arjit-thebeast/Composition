## Connecting CrewAI with Twitch
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Twitch

Twitch is a live streaming platform focused on video gaming, esports, and creative content.

### Integrating Twitch with CrewAI

Integrating Twitch & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Streaming live video gaming sessions
2. Hosting esports tournaments
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Twitch
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Twitch App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Twitch
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add twitch # One line to authenticate, configure and add Twitch integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions twitch "Streaming live video gaming sessions" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Twitch CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Twitch
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Twitch
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TWITCH]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Twitch API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Streaming live video gaming sessions"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Twitch Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Twitch using Twitch APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Twitch on users behalf. You need to take action on Twitch using Twitch APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_twitch = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.TWITCH_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_twitch = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TWITCH])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_twitch = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TWITCH], tags=[Tag.TWITCH_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
