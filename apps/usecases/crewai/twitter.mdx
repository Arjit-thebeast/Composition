## Connecting CrewAI with Twitter

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Twitter

Twitter, Inc. was an American social media company based in San Francisco, California, which operated and was named for named for its flagship social media network prior to its rebrand as X.

### Integrating Twitter with CrewAI

Integrating Twitter & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Sending tweets and direct messages
2. Creating and managing Twitter lists
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Twitter

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Twitter App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Twitter
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add twitter # One line to authenticate, configure and add Twitter integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions twitter "Sending tweets and direct messages" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Twitter CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Twitter
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Twitter
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TWITTER]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Twitter API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Sending tweets and direct messages"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Twitter Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Twitter using Twitter APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Twitter on users behalf. You need to take action on Twitter using Twitter APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_twitter = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.TWITTER_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_twitter = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TWITTER])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_twitter = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.TWITTER], tags=[Tag.TWITTER_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
