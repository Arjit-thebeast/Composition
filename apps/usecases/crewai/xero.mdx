## Connecting CrewAI with Xero

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Xero

Xero online accounting software for your business connects you to your bank, accountant, bookkeeper, and other business apps.

### Integrating Xero with CrewAI

Integrating Xero & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Managing business finances efficiently
2. Automating financial reporting
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Xero

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Xero App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Xero
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add xero # One line to authenticate, configure and add Xero integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions xero "Managing business finances efficiently" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Xero CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Xero
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Xero
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.XERO]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Xero API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Managing business finances efficiently"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Xero Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Xero using Xero APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Xero on users behalf. You need to take action on Xero using Xero APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_xero = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.XERO_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_xero = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.XERO])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_xero = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.XERO], tags=[Tag.XERO_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
