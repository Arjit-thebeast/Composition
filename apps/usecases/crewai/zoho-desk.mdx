## Connecting CrewAI with Zoho Desk

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Zoho Desk

Zoho Desk is a context-aware help desk software that helps businesses focus on the customer. It's convenient to manage customer support tickets, automate processes, and analyze operations.

### Integrating Zoho Desk with CrewAI

Integrating Zoho Desk & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Managing customer support tickets
2. Automating customer support processes
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Zoho Desk

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Zoho Desk App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Zoho Desk
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add zoho-desk # One line to authenticate, configure and add Zoho Desk integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions zoho-desk "Managing customer support tickets" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Zoho Desk CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Zoho Desk
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Zoho Desk
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ZOHO-DESK]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Zoho Desk API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Managing customer support tickets"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Zoho Desk Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Zoho Desk using Zoho Desk APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Zoho Desk on users behalf. You need to take action on Zoho Desk using Zoho Desk APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_zoho-desk = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.ZOHO-DESK_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_zoho-desk = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ZOHO-DESK])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_zoho-desk = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ZOHO-DESK], tags=[Tag.ZOHO-DESK_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
