## Connecting CrewAI with Zoho Invoice

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Zoho Invoice

Zoho Invoice is online invoicing software that helps you craft beautiful invoices, automatically send payment reminders and get paid faster online.

### Integrating Zoho Invoice with CrewAI

Integrating Zoho Invoice & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. sending invoices to clients
2. tracking payment statuses
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Zoho Invoice

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Zoho Invoice App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Zoho Invoice
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add zoho-invoice # One line to authenticate, configure and add Zoho Invoice integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions zoho-invoice "sending invoices to clients" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Zoho Invoice CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Zoho Invoice
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Zoho Invoice
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ZOHO-INVOICE]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Zoho Invoice API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "sending invoices to clients"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Zoho Invoice Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Zoho Invoice using Zoho Invoice APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Zoho Invoice on users behalf. You need to take action on Zoho Invoice using Zoho Invoice APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_zoho-invoice = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.ZOHO-INVOICE_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_zoho-invoice = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ZOHO-INVOICE])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_zoho-invoice = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ZOHO-INVOICE], tags=[Tag.ZOHO-INVOICE_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
