## Connecting LangChain AI agents with Box

### Overview of LangChain

LangChain is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Box

Cloud content management and file sharing service for businesses.

### Integrating Box with LangChain

Integrating Box & Langchain can allow for the following:

1. sharing files and documents within an organization
2. organizing content in a structured knowledge base
& so many more

## Using LangChain with Box

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Box App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Box
pip install composio_langchain # Install langchain, Composio 

composio-cli add box # One line to authenticate, configure and add Box integration for langchain
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to langchain agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions box "sharing files and documents within an organization" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from langchain.agents import create_openai_functions_agent, AgentExecutor
from langchain import hub
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI


llm = ChatOpenAI()

prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Box Langchain Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Box
# Import from composio_langchain
from composio_langchain import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Box
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.BOX]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent, set up an executor, and invoke tasks to perform Box API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python Langchain Agent executes the task

task = "sharing files and documents within an organization"

agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

# Execute using agent_executor
agent_executor.invoke({"input": task})
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
toolsGithubCreateIssue = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
toolsAsanaGithub = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ASANA, App.GITHUB])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
toolsAsanaGithub = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.NOTION], tags=[Tag.NOTION_BLOCK])
```
</CodeGroup>
