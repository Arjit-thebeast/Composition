## Connecting LangChain AI agents with SmartRecruiters
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of LangChain

LangChain is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of SmartRecruiters

Hiring Without Boundariesâ„¢ Move Faster and Hire Smarter with a Modern, All-in-One Hiring Platform.

### Integrating SmartRecruiters with LangChain

Integrating SmartRecruiters & Langchain can allow for the following:

1. Streamlining the recruitment process by providing a centralized platform for all hiring activities.
2. Enhancing collaboration among hiring teams by offering tools for communication and feedback within the platform.
& so many more

## Using LangChain with SmartRecruiters
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the SmartRecruiters App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising SmartRecruiters
pip install composio_langchain # Install langchain, Composio 

composio-cli add smartrecruiters # One line to authenticate, configure and add SmartRecruiters integration for langchain
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to langchain agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions smartrecruiters "Streamlining the recruitment process by providing a centralized platform for all hiring activities." --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from langchain.agents import create_openai_functions_agent, AgentExecutor
from langchain import hub
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI


llm = ChatOpenAI()

prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all SmartRecruiters Langchain Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For SmartRecruiters
# Import from composio_langchain
from composio_langchain import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for SmartRecruiters
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SMARTRECRUITERS]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent, set up an executor, and invoke tasks to perform SmartRecruiters API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python Langchain Agent executes the task

task = "Streamlining the recruitment process by providing a centralized platform for all hiring activities."

agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

# Execute using agent_executor
agent_executor.invoke({"input": task})
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
toolsGithubCreateIssue = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
toolsAsanaGithub = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ASANA, App.GITHUB])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
toolsAsanaGithub = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.NOTION], tags=[Tag.NOTION_BLOCK])
```
</CodeGroup>
