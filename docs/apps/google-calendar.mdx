## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

<Tip>The Google Calendar API needs to be enabled in the [Enabled APIs and Services section](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?) on the Google Console Dashboard and the OAuth 2.0 Client ID can be obtained from the [Credentials section](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?).</Tip>
