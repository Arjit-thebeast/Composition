> Hubspot uses OAuth2 for authentication.

## 📔 Documentation

- [Hubspot OAuth Documention](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/working-with-oauth)
- [Hubspot API documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/overview)

## ⚙️ Configuration

<Tip>
New App can be created at [Hubspot Developer Portal](https://app.hubspot.com/myaccounts).
</Tip>

Once you create the App, go to the "OAuth" tab and configure the below Redirect URL:

```
https://backend.composio.dev/api/v1/auth-apps/hubspot/connection/oauth2/add
```

After adding the Redirect URL, find your Client ID and Client Secret listed in the "Auth" tab and copy them for later use. On Composio's [supported apps](https://app.composio.dev/apps) page, find Hubspot and click "Enable". Paste your Client ID and Secret, then Save to connect Hubspot.
