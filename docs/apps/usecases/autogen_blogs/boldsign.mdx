## Connecting Autogen AI agents with BoldSign
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of BoldSign

BoldSign is an easy-to-use and secure electronic signature solution. With BoldSign you can quickly complete your contracts, accept offers, sign NDAs, approve invoices, confirm service appointments, onboard new employees, and more with just few clicks.

### Integrating BoldSign with Autogen

Integrating BoldSign & Autogen can allow for the following:

1. Quickly complete contracts and accept offers using electronic signatures
2. Sign ndas and approve invoices effortlessly
& so many more

## Using Autogen with BoldSign
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the BoldSign App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising BoldSign
pip install composio_autogen # Install autogen, Composio 

composio-cli add boldsign # One line to authenticate, configure and add BoldSign integration for Autogen
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio supports over 100 actions per app, but supplying all to Autogen agents reduces accuracy.
Selecting actions relevant to the use case enhances accuracy.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Select Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions boldsign "Quickly complete contracts and accept offers using electronic signatures" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from composio_autogen import ComposioToolset, App, Action
import os

llm_config = {"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]}

chatbot = AssistantAgent(
    "chatbot",
    system_message="Reply TERMINATE when the task is done or when user's content is empty",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

# create a UserProxyAgent instance named "user_proxy"
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    "user_proxy",
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "") and "TERMINATE" in x.get("content", ""),
    human_input_mode="NEVER", # Don't take input from User
    code_execution_config = {"use_docker": False}
)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Select BoldSign Autogen Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For BoldSign
# Import from composio_autogen
from composio_autogen import ComposioToolset, App, Action

# Initialise the Composio Tool Set
composio_tools = ComposioToolset()

# Register the preferred Applications, with right executor. 
composio_tools.register_actions(actions=[],caller=chatbot, executor=user_proxy)

# Get All the Actions for BoldSign
# composio_tools.register_tools(tools=[App.BOLDSIGN],caller=chatbot, executor=user_proxy) 
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent, set up an executor, and invoke tasks to perform BoldSign API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python Autogen Agent executes the task

task = "Quickly complete contracts and accept offers using electronic signatures" # change this as necessary

response = user_proxy.initiate_chat(chatbot,message=task)

print(response.chat_history)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
'content'...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
