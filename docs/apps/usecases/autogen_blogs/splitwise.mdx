## Connecting Autogen AI agents with Splitwise
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of Splitwise

Splitwise helps you split bills and expenses with friends and family.

### Integrating Splitwise with Autogen

Integrating Splitwise & Autogen can allow for the following:

1. Splitting bills and expenses with friends and family
2. Managing group expenses and tracking balances
& so many more

## Using Autogen with Splitwise
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Splitwise App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Splitwise
pip install composio_autogen # Install autogen, Composio 

composio-cli add splitwise # One line to authenticate, configure and add Splitwise integration for Autogen
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio supports over 100 actions per app, but supplying all to Autogen agents reduces accuracy.
Selecting actions relevant to the use case enhances accuracy.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Select Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions splitwise "Splitting bills and expenses with friends and family" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from composio_autogen import ComposioToolset, App, Action
import os

llm_config = {"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]}

chatbot = AssistantAgent(
    "chatbot",
    system_message="Reply TERMINATE when the task is done or when user's content is empty",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

# create a UserProxyAgent instance named "user_proxy"
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    "user_proxy",
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "") and "TERMINATE" in x.get("content", ""),
    human_input_mode="NEVER", # Don't take input from User
    code_execution_config = {"use_docker": False}
)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Select Splitwise Autogen Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Splitwise
# Import from composio_autogen
from composio_autogen import ComposioToolset, App, Action

# Initialise the Composio Tool Set
composio_tools = ComposioToolset()

# Register the preferred Applications, with right executor. 
composio_tools.register_actions(actions=[],caller=chatbot, executor=user_proxy)

# Get All the Actions for Splitwise
# composio_tools.register_tools(tools=[App.SPLITWISE],caller=chatbot, executor=user_proxy) 
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent, set up an executor, and invoke tasks to perform Splitwise API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python Autogen Agent executes the task

task = "Splitting bills and expenses with friends and family" # change this as necessary

response = user_proxy.initiate_chat(chatbot,message=task)

print(response.chat_history)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
'content'...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
