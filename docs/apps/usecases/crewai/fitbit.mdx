## Connecting CrewAI with Fitbit
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Fitbit

Fitbit is a line of wireless-enabled wearable technology, physical fitness monitors and activity trackers such as smartwatches, pedometers and monitors for heart rate, quality of sleep, and stairs climbed as well as related software.

### Integrating Fitbit with CrewAI

Integrating Fitbit & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Tracking physical activity and health metrics
2. Analyzing sleep patterns
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Fitbit
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Fitbit App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Fitbit
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add fitbit # One line to authenticate, configure and add Fitbit integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions fitbit "Tracking physical activity and health metrics" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Fitbit CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Fitbit
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Fitbit
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.FITBIT]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Fitbit API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Tracking physical activity and health metrics"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Fitbit Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Fitbit using Fitbit APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Fitbit on users behalf. You need to take action on Fitbit using Fitbit APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_fitbit = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.FITBIT_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_fitbit = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.FITBIT])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_fitbit = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.FITBIT], tags=[Tag.FITBIT_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
