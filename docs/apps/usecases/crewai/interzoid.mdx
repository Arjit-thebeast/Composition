## Connecting CrewAI with Interzoid
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Interzoid

Interzoid provides AI-enhanced data matching solutions, including a comprehensive API-first data platform, interactive web applications, and seamless integration with cloud data sources.

### Integrating Interzoid with CrewAI

Integrating Interzoid & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Enhancing data accuracy by cleaning and matching data sets
2. Integrating with cloud data sources to provide seamless data quality solutions
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Interzoid
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Interzoid App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Interzoid
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add interzoid # One line to authenticate, configure and add Interzoid integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions interzoid "Enhancing data accuracy by cleaning and matching data sets" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Interzoid CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Interzoid
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Interzoid
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.INTERZOID]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Interzoid API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Enhancing data accuracy by cleaning and matching data sets"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Interzoid Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Interzoid using Interzoid APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Interzoid on users behalf. You need to take action on Interzoid using Interzoid APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_interzoid = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.INTERZOID_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_interzoid = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.INTERZOID])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_interzoid = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.INTERZOID], tags=[Tag.INTERZOID_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
