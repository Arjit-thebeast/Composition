## Connecting CrewAI with ncScale
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of ncScale

ncScale provides a robust data API for programmatically interacting with and manipulating ncScale data.

### Integrating ncScale with CrewAI

Integrating ncScale & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Programmatically interacting with ncscale data
2. Manipulating ncscale data
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with ncScale
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the ncScale App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising ncScale
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add ncscale # One line to authenticate, configure and add ncScale integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions ncscale "Programmatically interacting with ncscale data" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all ncScale CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For ncScale
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for ncScale
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.NCSCALE]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform ncScale API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Programmatically interacting with ncscale data"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='ncScale Agent',
    goal="""You take action on ncScale using ncScale APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on ncScale on users behalf. You need to take action on ncScale using ncScale APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_ncscale = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.NCSCALE_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_ncscale = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.NCSCALE])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_ncscale = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.NCSCALE], tags=[Tag.NCSCALE_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
