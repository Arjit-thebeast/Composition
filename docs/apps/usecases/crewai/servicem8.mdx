## Connecting CrewAI with ServiceM8
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of ServiceM8

ServiceM8 is a cloud-based solution that helps field service businesses manage their operations, from job scheduling to invoicing.

### Integrating ServiceM8 with CrewAI

Integrating ServiceM8 & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Job scheduling
2. Invoicing
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with ServiceM8
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the ServiceM8 App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising ServiceM8
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add servicem8 # One line to authenticate, configure and add ServiceM8 integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions servicem8 "Job scheduling" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all ServiceM8 CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For ServiceM8
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for ServiceM8
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SERVICEM8]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform ServiceM8 API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Job scheduling"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='ServiceM8 Agent',
    goal="""You take action on ServiceM8 using ServiceM8 APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on ServiceM8 on users behalf. You need to take action on ServiceM8 using ServiceM8 APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_servicem8 = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.SERVICEM8_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_servicem8 = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SERVICEM8])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_servicem8 = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SERVICEM8], tags=[Tag.SERVICEM8_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
