## Connecting CrewAI with Slack
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Slack

Slack is a channel-based messaging platform. With Slack, people can work together more effectively, connect all their software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work â€” all within a secure, enterprise-grade environment.

### Integrating Slack with CrewAI

Integrating Slack & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Sending messages to a slack channel
2. Creating a new channel
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Slack
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Slack App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Slack
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add slack # One line to authenticate, configure and add Slack integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions slack "Sending messages to a slack channel" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Slack CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Slack
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Slack
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SLACK]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Slack API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Sending messages to a slack channel"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Slack Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Slack using Slack APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Slack on users behalf. You need to take action on Slack using Slack APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_slack = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.SLACK_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_slack = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SLACK])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_slack = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.SLACK], tags=[Tag.SLACK_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
