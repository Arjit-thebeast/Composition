## Connecting CrewAI with Strava
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Strava

Strava is a social fitness network and app designed for cyclists and runners.

### Integrating Strava with CrewAI

Integrating Strava & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Tracking fitness activities
2. Sharing activity data with friends
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with Strava
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Strava App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Strava
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add strava # One line to authenticate, configure and add Strava integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions strava "Tracking fitness activities" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Strava CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Strava
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Strava
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.STRAVA]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform Strava API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Tracking fitness activities"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='Strava Agent',
    goal="""You take action on Strava using Strava APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on Strava on users behalf. You need to take action on Strava using Strava APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_strava = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.STRAVA_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_strava = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.STRAVA])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_strava = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.STRAVA], tags=[Tag.STRAVA_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
