## Connecting CrewAI with ZenSERP
![intro](/media/intro.jpg)

### Overview of CrewAI

CrewAI is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of ZenSERP

ZenSERP provides APIs for search engine result pages (SERP) data, including organic results, ads, related searches, and more.

### Integrating ZenSERP with CrewAI

Integrating ZenSERP & CrewAI can allow for the following:

1. Extracting organic search results for keyword analysis
2. Tracking and analyzing search engine ads
& so many more

## Using CrewAI with ZenSERP
![intro-gif](/media/intro.gif)
<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the ZenSERP App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising ZenSERP
pip install composio_crewai # Install crewai, Composio 

composio-cli add zenserp # One line to authenticate, configure and add ZenSERP integration for crewai
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to crewai agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions zenserp "Extracting organic search results for keyword analysis" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from crewai import Agent, Task
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="sk-<OPENAI KEY>")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all ZenSERP CrewAI Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For ZenSERP
# Import from composio_crewai
from composio_crewai import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for ZenSERP
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ZENSERP]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent and execute tasks to perform ZenSERP API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python CrewAI Agent executes the task

task = "Extracting organic search results for keyword analysis"

crewai_agent = Agent(
    role='ZenSERP Agent',
    goal="""You take action on ZenSERP using ZenSERP APIs""",
    backstory="""You are AI agent that is responsible for taking actions on ZenSERP on users behalf. You need to take action on ZenSERP using ZenSERP APIs""",
    verbose=True,
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm
)

task = Task(
    description=task,
    agent=crewai_agent,
    expected_output="Check if the task was successfully executed"
)

task.execute()
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
tools_zenserp = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.ZENSERP_{ACTION_NAME}])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
tools_zenserp = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ZENSERP])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
tools_zenserp = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ZENSERP], tags=[Tag.ZENSERP_IMPORTANT])
```
</CodeGroup>
