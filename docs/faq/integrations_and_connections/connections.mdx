### Listing All Connections for an Entity
To view all the connections associated with your Composio account, use the following command:
<CodeGroup>
```python Python Connections for a User
from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet

tool_set = ComposioToolSet()

entity = tool_set.get_entity(id="entity_id")

print(entity.get_connections())
```

```javascript Javascript Connections for a User
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";

const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet({});

const entity = await toolset.client.getEntity("default");

console.log(await entity.getConnections());
```
</CodeGroup>

### Getting Connection Details
To get detailed information about a specific connection, use the get command followed by the connection ID. For example, to get details of a connection with the ID 123, you would use:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python Get connection details
from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, App

tool_set = ComposioToolSet()

connected_account = tool_set.get_connected_account(id="connected_account_id")
```

```javascript Javascript Get connection details
import { Composio } from "composio-core";
// get composio client
const composio = new Composio();

const connected_account = await composio.connectedAccounts.get({
  connectedAccountId: "connected_account_id",
});
```
</CodeGroup>
