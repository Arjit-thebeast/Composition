### Listing All Integrations
To retrieve a complete list of your integrations, you can use the following code snippets.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python List all integrations
from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, App

tool_set = ComposioToolSet()

integrations = tool_set.get_integrations()
```

```javascript Javascript List all integrations
import {Composio} from "composio-core";

// get composio client
const composio = new Composio();

const integrations = await composio.integrations.list({})
```
</CodeGroup>

This command will display a comprehensive list of all integrations

### Getting Integration Details
To get detailed information about a specific integration, use the get command followed by the integration ID. For example, to get details of a connection with the ID 123, you would use:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python Get integration details
from composio import Composio

client = Composio()

integration = tool_set.get_integration(id="integration_id")
```

```javascript Javascript Get integration details
import { Composio } from "composio-core";

// get composio client
const composio = new Composio();

const integration = await composio.integrations.get({
  integrationId: "integration_id",
});
```
</CodeGroup>
