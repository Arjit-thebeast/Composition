description: "This guide provides detailed steps to create an Investment Analyst Agent that leverages LangChain and Composio 
to perform investment research, analyze stocks, and offer recommendations based on user input"
---
This project involves setting up and running an agent to conduct investment research, analyze the research, and provide investment recommendations. We use LangChain to set up the Agent, and Composio is used to add the tools we need, in this case, we need SERP. Follow this guide to set up and run the project.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Project Setup">
    > Fork and Clone this [repository](https://git.new/composio), Navigate to the Project Directory 

    `cd cookbook/examples/javascript/investment_analyst`

    Install the required dependencies:
    <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Install Dependencies
        ## Any of the following commands will install the required dependencies
        npm install
        yarn install 
        pnpm install
        ```

    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Imports and Environment Setup">
    In your JavaScript file, import the necessary libraries and set up your environment variables.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```javascript Import statements
        import dotenv from 'dotenv';
        import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
        import { AgentExecutor, createOpenAIFunctionsAgent } from "langchain/agents";
        import { LangchainToolSet } from "composio-core";
        import { pull } from "langchain/hub";

        dotenv.config();
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Initialize Language Model and Define tools">
    We'll initialize our language model and set up the necessary tools for our agent.
    We will be using the SERP tool, so that our agent can execute actions using this tool.    
    <CodeGroup>
        ```javascript LLM and Tools
        // Initialize the language model with OpenAI API key and model name
        const llm = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4-turbo" });

        // Setup tools using ComposioToolSet
        const composioToolset = new LangchainToolSet({
            apiKey: process.env.COMPOSIO_API_KEY
        });
        const tools = await composioToolset.getActions({
            actions: ["serpapi_search"]
        });
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

   <Step title="Defining the Agent">
   Define the roles and goals of our agent. We'll create a single agent that combines the roles of researcher, analyst, and recommender.
   <CodeGroup>
       ```javascript Agent
        const prompt = await pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent");
        
        const agent = await createOpenAIFunctionsAgent({
            llm,
            tools,
            prompt,
        });

        const agentExecutor = new AgentExecutor({
            agent,
            tools,
            verbose: true,
        });
        ```
   </CodeGroup>
   </Step>

    <Step title="Executing the Agent">
    Create a function to run the agent and execute the process.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```javascript Execute
        async function runInvestmentAnalysis(topic) {
            const result = await agentExecutor.invoke({
                input: `Conduct a comprehensive investment analysis on ${topic}. 
                        First, research the topic using SERP to get the latest information. 
                        Then, analyze the gathered information for investment insights. 
                        Finally, provide investment recommendations, listing pros and cons as bullet points.`
            });

            console.log(result.output);
            return result.output;
        }

        // Example usage
        const topic = "Tesla stock";
        runInvestmentAnalysis(topic);
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Putting it All Together
<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript Final Code
    import dotenv from 'dotenv';
    import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
    import { AgentExecutor, createOpenAIFunctionsAgent } from "langchain/agents";
    import { LangchainToolSet } from "composio-core";
    import { pull } from "langchain/hub";

    dotenv.config();

    // Initialize the language model with OpenAI API key and model name
    const llm = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4-turbo" });

    // Setup tools using ComposioToolSet
    const composioToolset = new LangchainToolSet({
        apiKey: process.env.COMPOSIO_API_KEY
    });

    const prompt = await pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent");
    
    const agent = await createOpenAIFunctionsAgent({
        llm,
        tools,
        prompt,
    });

    const agentExecutor = new AgentExecutor({
        agent,
        tools,
        verbose: true,
    });

    async function runInvestmentAnalysis(topic) {
            const tools = await composioToolset.getActions({
            actions: ["serpapi_search"]
        });
        const result = await agentExecutor.invoke({
            input: `Conduct a comprehensive investment analysis on ${topic}. 
                    First, research the topic using SERP to get the latest information. 
                    Then, analyze the gathered information for investment insights. 
                    Finally, provide investment recommendations, listing pros and cons as bullet points.`
        });

        console.log(result.output);
        return result.output;
    }

    // Example usage
    const topic = "Tesla stock";
    runInvestmentAnalysis(topic);
    ```
</CodeGroup>

This JavaScript implementation uses LangChain to create an agent that performs investment research, analysis, and recommendations. It utilizes the Composio toolset to access the SERP tool for web searches. The agent combines the roles of researcher, analyst, and recommender into a single entity, streamlining the process while still achieving the desired outcome.
