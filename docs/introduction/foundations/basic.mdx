Let's get you started building with Composio! This section will get you familiar with Composioâ€™s core concepts.

Goal of this section is to give you a brief walkthrough of each component and how they go together.

In next few pages, we can go through each component in detail. They will explain how to use each component in the code and what the expected flow should look like.
