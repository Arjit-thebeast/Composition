### Introduction to Actions
Actions are **interfaces for interacting** with **external world** via - 
1. **Tool API calls** (e.g., gmail API to send an email)
2. **System Code execution** (e.g., Python code to generate a report)

<CodeGroup>
```python Python Fetching an Action
tools = tool_set.get_tools(actions=[Action.GITHUB_ACTIVITY_STAR_REPO_FOR_AUTHENTICATED_USER]) 
```

```javascript JavaScript Fetching an Action
const tools = await composioToolset.getTools({
    actions: ["github_star_a_repository_for_the_authenticated_user"]
});
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Actions are function calling compatible which means they can be used via Agentic Frameworks or any other LLMs.
</Note>

### Action Types

1. **Actions to Manage External Tools**: These are actions that are pre-configured for specific tools like **Asana tool** has actions for creating tasks, adding comments, etc.
2. **Actions to Manage System**: Actions that **interact with the execution environment**, including **file systems, shell commands, and browser automation**.
3. **Custom Actions**: These are custom code actions that you write in Python, JavaScript. It can also **extend the capabilities of Composio to interact with any existing/new tools**.

### Action Limits

<Warning>
    Giving LLM's too many actions can lead to significant performance issues.
    <CodeGroup>
    ```python python
    tools = tool_set.get_tools(apps=[App.ASANA]) 
    # Asana has 100+ actions
    ```
    ```javascript javascript
    const tools = toolset.getTools({
      apps: ["github"]
    }) // Github has 100+ actions
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
</Warning>
  
<Info>Empirical evidence indicates that agents perform optimally when limited to fewer than 20 actions.</Info>

To optimize agent performance, it's essential to limit the number of actions available. This can be achieved through effective action filtering strategies.

Here are some recommended approaches:
1. Use specific actions from a tool
2. Implement custom filtering logic

By carefully curating the action set, you can significantly improve agent efficiency and response quality.
