## Overview of Integrations

Integrations in Composio are configuration objects that define how your application connects to external services and APIs. Each integration encapsulates the authentication details, permissions, and API specifications needed to establish secure connections with services like GitHub, Slack, or HubSpot.

<Note>
  Integrations include critical configuration like OAuth credentials (Client ID/Secret), required permissions scopes, and API endpoint specifications that determine how your users can interact with the external service.
</Note>

For example:
- When you create a GitHub integration, you specify OAuth authentication parameters and permission scopes like "repo:read"
- This integration then serves as a reusable template - any user connecting their GitHub account through this integration will have the same standardized access level and authentication flow
- This ensures consistent and secure access patterns across your entire user base

So ideally you will only build **one integration per tool or application** and **allow all your users to connect using it**.
