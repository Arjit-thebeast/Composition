## Overview of Integrations

Integrations allow users to link their accounts with external apps, enabling agents to take actions on their behalf. You can view all active integrations and monitor live connections or users by visiting the [Dashboard](https://app.composio.dev/your_apps).

Integrations are tool configurations (eg. Permissions to ask for when connecting an account, ClientID/Secret in the case of OAuth) that will be used to connect your users account to Composio. You can use your own configuration or use Composio's default integrations.

Once an integration is established, it can be utilized by an **unlimited number of users** to connect their accounts. So ideally you will only build **one integration per tool or application** and **allow all your users to connect using it**.

To authenticate users with a specific tool, create a new integration by selecting the desired tool on the [Tools Page](https://app.composio.dev/apps). Integrations can be established using either default credentials or by registering a new developer application and setting the necessary authentication and permission scopes.

## Creating a New Integration  (~ 2Ô∏è‚É£ üï∞Ô∏è minutes )

To facilitate actions on behalf of your users, start by selecting the app you want to integrate.

<Steps>

<Step title="Selecting the Preferred Tool">
  <AccordionGroup title="Tool Selection Options">
    <Accordion title="Default Tools">
      Choose from a list of tools already supported by Composio. [View all supported tools](https://app.composio.dev/apps).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Custom Tools: YAML Configuration">
      Integrate your custom tools that comply with OAuth, Apikey, or other supported authentication standards. [Learn more](https://docs.composio.dev/integrations/custom-integration) (feature coming soon).
    </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>
  In this guide, we will select 'Slack' from the available default tools. Go to the [tools page](https://app.composio.dev/apps), select [Slack](https://app.composio.dev/app/slack), and click the 'Setup' button in the upper right corner.
</Step>

<Step title="Configuring the Integration">
  Integrating tools that use OAuth or similar authentication methods typically requires registering a developer application. Composio provides default credentials for quick setup. However, for a more customized user experience, where the authorization page displays "Authorizing YOURAPP" instead of "Authorizing Composio," you should register your own application and enter the required credentials.

  <AccordionGroup title="Configuration Options">
    <Accordion title="Use Default Composio Credentials">
      Ideal for rapid testing and deployment. Note that the authorization page will display Composio's name, which may not be suitable for all production environments.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Use Your Own Credentials">
      Configure your integration with custom credentials. [See how to configure credentials for Slack](https://docs.composio.dev/apps/slack).
    </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Finalizing the Integration">
  Assign a name to your integration and save your integration. Upon saving, you will be directed to the integration's page. 
  Here, locate the integration ID, which is essential for referencing this integration in your application code.
