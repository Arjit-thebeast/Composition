## Overview

**Local Tools** in Composio empower users to execute actions directly on their machines, providing privacy and customization benefits. Composio offers two main types of tools:

1. **Composio-Managed Tools:** Executed on Composio’s end.
2. **Local Tools:** Executed locally on the user’s machine.

This guide focuses on **Local Tools** and outlines how you can create and add your own tools to integrate with Composio’s supported platforms.

### Why Use Local Tools?

Local tools provide several advantages:

- Data privacy: Execution happens on the user’s machine, ensuring sensitive data doesn’t leave the local environment.
- Flexibility: Users can create and customize as many tools and actions as needed.
- Compatibility: Custom tools and actions can be integrated seamlessly across various Composio-supported platforms.

Additionally, you can extend the functionality of existing tools like GitHub, Gmail, or Jira by creating **Custom Actions**. These actions can leverage existing authentication details from user-connected accounts to perform personalized tasks.

## Available Local Tools

Composio has already added many useful local tools, and we are continuously expanding the list. 

- Explore the current list of available [local tools](./list_local_tools).
- To access the entire repository of tools, visit the [Composio GitHub](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/tree/master/python/composio/tools/local).

## Adding a Local Tool (Python Example)

You can easily create your own local tool in Python and integrate it with Composio. Below are the steps to guide you through the process.

### Step 1: Add the Action Decorator

In your code, add @action(toolname=[TOOL_NAME], requires=["LIBRARIES"]) decorater to the function that returns the response to the LLM.

Specify the tool name as the decorater’s parameter

and save it in a file called local_tool.py
```python
from composio import action

@action(toolname="cow", requires=["cowsay"])
def say(message: str) -> str:
    """
    Cow will say whatever you want it to say.

    :param message: Message string
    :return greeting: Formatted message.
    """
    import cowsay

    return cowsay.get_output_string("cow", message)
```

In this example, we create a custom tool called "cow" that uses the `cowsay` library to output a message.

### Step 2: Import and Use Your Custom Action

Once your action is ready, import it into your main file and integrate it with your Composio agent framework.

```python
from composio import action, ComposioToolSet
from local_tool import say

composio_toolset = ComposioToolSet()

# Retrieve and use the local tool
tools = composio_toolset.execute_action(
        actions=say,  # This is the action from the tool we created
        params={
            'message':"hello"
        }),
print(tools)
```

## Custom Actions in Composio

Composio's **Custom Actions** allow you to expand the capabilities of existing tools by creating actions tailored to specific tasks. These actions can also utilize existing authentication details for services like GitHub to perform operations without requiring additional logins.

### Example: Creating a Custom Action to Return Authentication Details

Here’s how you can create a custom action that returns authentication details for a particular service (in this case, GitHub):

```python
@action(toolname="github")
def return_auth(auth: dict) -> auth:
    """
    Retrieve GitHub account information.
    """
    return auth

print(
    toolset.execute_action(
        action=return_auth,
        params={},
    )
)
```

This action returns the authentication details for the connected GitHub account.

## Additional Resources and Sample Code

Composio provides several sample tools to help you get started. We recommend reviewing the following tools as references:

- [Mathematical Tool](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/blob/master/python/composio/tools/local/mathematical/tool.py): A simple tool for performing mathematical operations.
- [Greptile Tool](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/blob/master/python/composio/tools/local/greptile/tool.py): A tool to integrate with the [Greptile](https://www.greptile.com/) framework.

For more information on how to create custom actions, explore our documentation [here](/patterns/functions/custom_actions).

By following these steps, you can easily create and manage local tools in Composio, unlocking a wide range of customizable capabilities tailored to your specific use case.
