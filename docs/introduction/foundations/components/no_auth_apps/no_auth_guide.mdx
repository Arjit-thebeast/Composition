## Apps Requiring No Authentication
Some apps in Composio don't require authentication to use. These apps can be added and updated easily using the Composio CLI. This guide will walk you through the process.

## Adding a No-Auth App
To add an app that doesn't require authentication, use the following command:
```bash 
composio add app_name
```
Replace app_name with the name of the app you want to add. For example:

```bash
composio add codeinterpreter
```
This command will add the CodeInterpreter to your Composio environment without requiring any authentication steps.

## Updating Apps
After adding a no-auth app (or any app), it's a good practice to update your apps to ensure you have the latest version and features. To update all your apps, use the following command:


```python
composio apps update
```
This command will check for updates for all your installed apps, including those that don't require authentication, and apply any available updates.
## List of Common No-Auth Apps
Here are some examples of apps that typically don't require authentication:

- WeatherMap
- CodeInterpreter
- Hackernews

<Note>
While these apps don't require authentication, always check the specific app's documentation in case there are any additional setup steps or API key requirements.

## Best Practices
Regularly update your apps to ensure you have the latest features and security updates.
Even though these apps don't require authentication, treat any data you process through them with appropriate care.
If an app starts requiring authentication in a future update, you'll be notified when running the update command.
By following these simple steps, you can quickly add and use apps that don't require authentication in your Composio projects.
