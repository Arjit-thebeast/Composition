### Authentication Management üîê

Composio handles the auth for your users, allowing you to execute **tools on behalf of a specific user.**

### Managed Execution Environment üöÄ

Composio enables you to:

- **Improve performance**, security, and cost efficiency by **optimising execution environments** at an individual tool level
- Utilize supported execution environments: **Local, Docker, E2B, Fly.io, Lambda, and more**

### Tools & Triggers Execution Logs üìä

Execution logs allow you to:

- **Inspect every function called by the LLM**, including input arguments and return values
- **Track timestamps for each execution** to understand and optimize latency
- **Measure Accuracy** of each tool call

### Custom Tools üõ†

With Composio, you can:

- Import custom API Definitions (OpenAPI, Postman, Swagger) to automatically add support for your custom tools
- Leverage support for different Authentication methods: **API Key, OAuth2, Basic Auth, Bearer Token, and more**
