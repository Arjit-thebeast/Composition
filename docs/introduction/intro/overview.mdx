## What is Composio?

Composio is an agentic integration platform that enables LLMs/AI agents to interact with **External Services** via **Function Calling**. 

Using Composio, you can:

- Connect AI agents to **APIs, RPCs, shells, file systems, and web browsers**
- **Manage user-level authentication** for multiple accounts across various tools
- Integrate with **any programming language** through our API-first approach
