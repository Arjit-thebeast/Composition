## Composio Quick Start

Composio empowers you to turn natural language into GitHub actions using AI. In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to use Composio and OpenAI to star a GitHub repository using natural language commands. This process showcases the powerful integration between AI language models and real-world actions on platforms like GitHub.

<Info>
    **What you'll achieve:** By the end of this guide, you'll have set up an AI-powered system capable of understanding natural language instructions and executing GitHub actions, specifically starring a repository.

<Steps>

    <Step title="Install Composio">
        Composio is a toolkit that facilitates AI-powered interactions with various services, including GitHub. Let's begin by installing the necessary packages:
        <CodeGroup>
            ```bash Install Packages
            pip install composio_core composio_openai

            composio login
            ```
        </CodeGroup>
        <Note>
            A CLI binary package is coming soon. If you're not using the CLI, you can skip the `composio login` command.
        </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Authenticate GitHub Account">
        To perform actions on GitHub, we need to securely authenticate your account with Composio. This step ensures that Composio can interact with GitHub on your behalf.

        Choose your preferred authentication method:

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="CLI (Quickest)">
                <CodeGroup>
                    ```bash Authenticate GitHub Account
                    composio add github # Launches GitHub login process
                    ```
                </CodeGroup>
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Python">
                <CodeGroup>
                    ```python Authenticate GitHub Account
                    from composio import ComposioToolSet, App

                    toolset = ComposioToolSet(entity_id="YourUsername")
                    entity = toolset.get_entity()
                    request = entity.initiate_connection(App.GITHUB)

                    print(f"Open this URL to authenticate: {request.redirectUrl}")
                    ```
                </CodeGroup>
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        <Warning>
            Make sure to complete the authentication process by following the URL provided in your console. This step is crucial for establishing a secure connection between Composio and your GitHub account.
        </Warning>

    </Step>

    <Step title="Initialize Composio and OpenAI">
        Now we'll set up the Composio and OpenAI clients. Composio provides the tools to interact with GitHub, while OpenAI powers the natural language understanding and decision-making process.
        <CodeGroup>
            ```python Initialize Clients
            from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, Action
            from openai import OpenAI

            openai_client = OpenAI()  # Initializes the OpenAI client for AI capabilities
            composio_toolset = ComposioToolSet()  # Initializes Composio for GitHub interactions
            ```
        </CodeGroup>

        <Tip>
            Ensure you've set your `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` as environment variables before running this code. These keys are essential for authenticating with Composio and OpenAI services respectively.
        </Tip>

    </Step>

    <Step title="Fetch GitHub Actions & Interact with LLM">
        In this step, we'll retrieve the specific GitHub action for starring repositories and prepare our AI model to understand and execute this task.

        <CodeGroup>
            ```python Star a repo using LLM
            # Fetch the GitHub 'star repository' action from Composio
            tools = composio_toolset.get_tools(actions=[Action.GITHUB_ACTIVITY_STAR_REPO_FOR_AUTHENTICATED_USER])

            # Define the task in natural language
            task = "Star the repo composiohq/composio on GitHub"

            # Use OpenAI to interpret the task and determine the appropriate action
            response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
                tools=tools,
                messages=[
                    {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant capable of interacting with GitHub."},
                    {"role": "user", "content": task},
                ],
            )
            ```
        </CodeGroup>
        This code fetches the GitHub 'star repository' action, presents a natural language task to the AI, and uses OpenAI to interpret the task and determine the appropriate GitHub action to take.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Execute Tool Calls">
        Finally, we'll execute the action determined by the AI. This step translates the AI's decision into an actual GitHub operation - starring the repository.

        <CodeGroup>
            ```python Execute Function calls
            # Execute the action determined by the AI
            result = composio_toolset.handle_tool_calls(response)
            print(result)
            ```
        </CodeGroup>
        This code takes the AI's response, which includes the determined action to star the repository, and executes it using Composio's tools. The result of the operation is then printed.

## What Just Happened? 🎉

Congratulations! You've just completed a powerful workflow that demonstrates the integration of AI with real-world actions:

1. 🔐 Authenticated your GitHub account with Composio, ensuring secure access to your GitHub actions.
2. 🛠 Fetched GitHub actions, specifically the ability to star repositories, making them available to the AI.
3. 🧠 Utilized an AI language model (via OpenAI) to interpret a natural language command and determine the appropriate GitHub action.
4. ⭐ Instructed the AI to star the `composiohq/composio` repository using natural language.
5. ✅ Successfully executed the AI-determined action on GitHub, resulting in a starred repository.

This demonstration showcases how Composio bridges the gap between AI language models and real-world actions on platforms like GitHub, enabling powerful, language-driven automation of tasks.
