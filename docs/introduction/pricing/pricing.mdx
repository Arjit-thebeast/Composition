### Pricing Philosophy
At Composio, **we believe agents have the power to transform how businesses operate**. Our mission is to make agents accessible to all. We offer a **generous free tier** so you can **experience agents** without upfront costs.

<Info>If you are a startup building around agents, we recommend you apply for our <a href="http://docs.composio.dev/introduction/pricing/startups-program">Startups Program</a>.</Info>
