Composio streamlines the authentication process, allowing you to securely connect your users to a wide range of third-party services.

## Key Concepts

### Supported Authentication Flows

Composio supports three primary authentication methods:

1. **OAuth**: Securely redirect users to third-party services (e.g., GitHub, Google) for authorization.
2. **Basic Auth**: Authenticate using username and password credentials.
3. **API Key**: Authenticate using a unique API key.
