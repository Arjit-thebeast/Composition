You can easily use Composio to Authenticate your users in various apps.

## Supported apps
Composio supports over 150+ apps including Github, Gmail, Jira, MailChimp etc., 

## Supported Auth flows
There are multiple Authentication flows we support:

1. **OAUTH:** Composio authenticates users by redirecting them to a third-party service (e.g., GitHub, Google) where they approve access.
2. **BASIC:** Composio allows the client to authenticate by sending a username and password directly to the third-party app.
3. **API_KEY:** Composio allows the client to authenticate by using an API Key.

## Integrations

Integrations allow users to link their accounts with external apps, enabling agents to take actions on their behalf.
Integrations are tool configurations (eg. Permissions to ask for when connecting an account, ClientID/Secret in the case of OAuth) that will be used to connect your users account to Composio.

### Where can I see my Integrations?
You can view all active integrations and monitor live connections or users by visiting the Dashboard.

### How can I use Integrations to connect my user's accounts?
Once an integration is established, it can be utilized by an unlimited number of users to connect their accounts.
So ideally you will only build one integration per tool or application and allow all your users to connect using it.


## Connected Accounts

A Connected Account is created, when your user connects their account under your Integration. 
This object securely stores authentication data such as access tokens and refresh tokens.

### How are these users represented?

Each unique user is represented by a unique entity id.
If you have **two users, Jessica and Melissa**, they will have unique entity ids
â€‹
### What can I do with this?

Your entire Authentication requirements for your users is handled by Composio. 
You can also execute various Actions on behalf of your users.
