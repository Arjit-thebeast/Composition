## Complete Whitelabelling Using Composio

### Using Your Own Developer App
When using your own developer app with Composio, it's important to properly configure the redirect URL. Here's how to do it:
1. Obtain the redirect URL after creating a connection request, ask your user to authenticate on that link.
2. After the user has connected their account - theyâ€™ll be redirected to the redirectURL you specified in query params
3. This ensures that after the OAuth flow is completed, users are redirected back to your application correctly.

### Specifying a Custom Redirect URL
When initiating a new connection, you can specify a custom redirect URL. This is useful for ensuring users are directed to the right page in your application after the authentication flow is complete. Here's an example:
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
COMING SOON
```

```javascript Javascript
const connectedAccountRequest = await composio.connectedAccounts.initiate({
    data: {
        "subdomain": "your_subdomain"
    },
    integrationId: "integration_id",
    redirectUrl: "https://your-website.com/auth/callback",
    entityId: "user_id"
});

console.log("Redirect url", connectedAccountRequest.redirectUrl);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Handling the Redirect
After the user has connected their account, they'll be redirected to the specified redirectUrl with query parameters containing important information:
**status**: Can be either 'ACTIVE' or 'ERROR'
**connectedAccountId**: The connected account ID for this user on Composio
**appName**: The name of the connected app
You can use these parameters to update your application's state and provide appropriate feedback to the user.
