### What is an Integration? (Controlling the OAuth Experience)

Integrations in Composio are configuration objects that define how your application connects to external services and APIs. Each integration encapsulates the authentication details, permissions, and API specifications needed to establish secure connections with services like GitHub, Slack, or HubSpot.

<Note>
  Integrations include critical configuration like OAuth credentials (Client ID/Secret), required permissions scopes, and API endpoint specifications that determine how your users can interact with the external service.
</Note>

For example:
- When you create a GitHub integration, you specify OAuth authentication parameters and permission scopes like "repo:read"
- This integration then serves as a reusable template - any user connecting their GitHub account through this integration will have the same standardized access level and authentication flow
- This ensures consistent and secure access patterns across your entire user base

### Creating an Integration

<Note> Recommended method to create an integration is via UI. (Only limited integrations are required) </Note>

<Info> One integration can be used by multiple users to connect their accounts. </Info>

![Creating an Integration with Dashboard](/patterns/Auth/gifs/only_integration.gif)

1. Login at [Composio's Website](https://app.composio.dev)
2. Go to the Tools section
3. Click on any app you want to integrate
4. Click on Setup on [App Name] Integration
5. Choose your integration name and click Save
6. Then Click on "Connect to [App Name]" and Authenticate with your Account
7. Congratulations! Integration was successful!

### Fetching all Integrations

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio import ComposioToolSet, App
toolset = ComposioToolSet()

print(toolset.get_integrations()) # get all integrations
print(toolset.get_integrations(app=App.GMAIL)) #filter based on app 
print(toolset.get_integration(id="ADD THE ID HERE")) #filter based on integration id

# By auth scheme
print(toolset.get_integrations(auth_scheme="BEARER_TOKEN"))
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";

const openai_client = new OpenAIToolSet({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAIKEY
});

console.log(openai_client.client.integrations.list()) //lists all integrations
console.log(openai_client.client.integrations.get({
    appName:'gmail'
})) //filter based on app name
console.log(await openai_client.client.integrations.get({integrationId:"ADD THE ID HERE"})) //filter based on integration id
```
</CodeGroup>

### Creating a new connection using an Integration

You can follow the same steps as mentioned in [Creating a new connection](/patterns/Auth/connected_account) and use integration object.
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio import ComposioToolSet

toolset = ComposioToolSet(api_key=os.getenv("COMPOSIO_API_KEY"), entity_id="Jessica")

entity = toolset.get_entity()

integration = entity.client.integrations.get_by_id("integration_id...")
connection_request = entity.initiate_connection(app_name="TWITTER", redirect_url="redirect_url...", integration=integration)

# If the connection method is OAuth, redirect the user to the URL below
print(connection_request.redirectUrl)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Whitelabeling the OAuth Developer App Using Integrations 

Integrations can be used to customise the OAuth Developer App that is shown to the user when initiating a connection.

Create an Integration and toggle on "Use your own Developer App"

Enter your ClientID and ClientSecret and save the integration.

Now you can use this integration and the user in auth flow should see the custom developer app.
