## Introduction to Entities

- **Each unique user** is represented by a **unique entity id**.
- If you have **two users, Jessica and Melissa**, they will have **unique entity ids**.

## Introduction to Connected Accounts
- When a user connects their account, a `connected_account` object is created. 
- This object securely stores **authentication data** such as **access tokens and refresh tokens**.


### Managing Entities

To retrieve an entity object using code, you can use the following code:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python Code Snippet to get an entity (user)
from composio import ComposioToolSet

toolset = ComposioToolSet()
entity = toolset.get_entity(id='Jessica')
```

```javascript JS Code Snippet to get an entity (user)
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";

const toolset = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAIKEY,
    entityId: 'Jessica'
});
const entity = toolset.client.getEntity(id='Jessica');
```
</CodeGroup>


You can use the entity object to manage the connected accounts for the user. You can also use the entity object to perform actions on behalf of the user and connect accounts for the user.

### Getting Connected Accounts

To get the connected accounts for an entity, you can use the following code:
<CodeGroup>
```python Python Code Snippet to get a connected account
try:
    connected_accounts = entity.get_connections() #lists all connections of the entity
    connected_accounts = entity.get_connection(app=App.GITHUB) #filters based on app name
    connected_accounts = entity.get_connection(connected_account_id="9") #filters based on connected account id for an entity
    print(connected_accounts)
except Exception as e:
    print("No connected account found")
```

```javascript JS Code Snippet to get a connected account
try {
    // filters based on connected account id for an entity
    let connectedAccounts = await entity.connectedAccounts.get({connectedAccountId: '9'})

    // filters connections based on appName for an entity
    let connectedAccounts = tool_set.client.integrations.get({appName: 'github'})

    // list all connections based on entityId
    let connectedAccounts = await entity.connectedAccounts.list()

    console.log(connectedAccounts)
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching connected accounts:', error.message)
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This code attempts to retrieve the connected account for Github. If no connected account is found, it catches the exception and prints a message.

## Performing Actions on Behalf of Users

<Info>Composio allows you to perform actions on behalf of users. </Info>

### Executing Actions without an Agent on behalf of a user

You can execute actions on behalf of a user without using an agent.
<CodeGroup>

```python Python Execute Action without an agent
res = entity.execute(
    action=Action.GITHUB_GITHUB_API_ROOT,
    params={},
)
print(res)
```

```javascript JS Execute Action without an agent
const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAIKEY,
    entityId: "Jessica"
});

const output = await toolset.client.actions.execute({
    actionName:'LINEAR_LIST_LINEAR_PROJECTS',
    requestBody:{
        connectedAccountId: "",
        input:{}
    },
});
console.log(output);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Performing Actions with an Agent on behalf of a user

You can use an agent to perform actions on behalf of a user. 

<CodeGroup>
```python Python Execute Action with an agent

from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, App
from openai import OpenAI

openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="******OPENAIKEY******")
tool_set = ComposioToolSet(entity_id="Jessica")
actions = tool_set.get_tools(actions=["GITHUB_STAR_A_REPOSITORY_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER"])

my_task = "Star the repo composiohq/composio on GitHub"

response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    tools=actions,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": my_task},
    ],
)
tool_set.handle_tool_calls(response=response, entity_id="Jessica")
```

```javascript JS Execute Action with an agent
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";

const openai_client = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
});

const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet({
    apiKey: process.env.COMPOSIO_API_KEY,
});

const tools = await toolset.getTools({actions: ['GITHUB_STAR_A_REPOSITORY_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER']})

const task = "Star the repo composiohq/composio on GitHub"

const response = await openai_client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    tools: tools,
    messages: [
        {role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {role: "user", content: task},
    ],
});

await toolset.handleToolCall(response, "Jessica");
```
</CodeGroup>

In this example, an agent is configured to star a repository on GitHub on behalf of the user. The OpenAI API is used to process the request and perform the action.
