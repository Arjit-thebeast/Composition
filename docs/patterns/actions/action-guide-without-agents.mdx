## Using Actions

Composio lets you perform actions with your account or on behalf of your users. Feel free to check all the [tools](https://app.composio.dev/apps) we support. 

### Execute Actions without Agents

To execute actions without using Agents, you can manually supply the parameters to execute the action or use natural language.

<CodeGroup>
 ```python Python Star a repo
from composio import ComposioToolSet, Action

tool_set = ComposioToolSet(entity_id="Jessica")
#If you did not run 'composio login' in the CLI, you can use API Key like this:
#tool_set = ComposioToolSet(api_key, entity_id="Jessica")

#You can change the repo you want to star by modifying the parameters
tool_set.execute_action(
    action=Action.GITHUB_STAR_A_REPOSITORY_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER,
    params={"owner": "composiohq", "repo": "composio"},
    entity_id="Jessica",
)
```

```javascript JavaScript Get Hypermedia links in GitHub
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core";

const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet();

const customAuthAction = await toolset.client.actions.execute({
    actionName: "GITHUB_GITHUB_API_ROOT",
    requestBody: {
        appName: "github",
        authConfig: {
            parameters: [{
                name: "Authorization",
                in: "header",
                value: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
            }]
        },
        input: {}
    }
});

console.log("Custom auth action response", customAuthAction)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Execute Actions with Natural Language
You can also execute Actions by passing in natural language prompts without specific parameters
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
  tool_set.execute_action(
      action=Action.GITHUB_STAR_A_REPOSITORY_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER,
      params={},
      text="Star the repo composiohq/composio",
      entity_id="Jessica",
  )
```

```javascript JavaScript
  await toolset.executeAction(
    'github_star_a_repository_for_the_authenticated_user',
    {},
    "Jessica",
    "Star the repo composiohq/composio"
  );
```
</CodeGroup>
