## What are Custom Actions?

In Composio, Custom Actions allow you to extend the functionality of existing tools by creating your own actions. These actions can use the authentication of an existing tool to perform specific tasks or retrieve information.

> Custom Actions can be created for any existing tool in Composio, allowing you to tailor the functionality to your specific needs while leveraging the existing authentication.

For example:
- Create a custom action for GitHub to retrieve account information using the existing GitHub authentication
- Use this action to get user-specific data from tools like GitHub within your application without managing separate authentication

## Creating a Custom Action

> Custom Actions are created using Python decorators and can be defined with Pydantic models for request/response validation.

> The `@action` decorator is used to register your function as a custom action for a specific tool, allowing it to use the tool's existing authentication.

Here's how you can create custom actions:

1. Import necessary modules and initialize the ComposioToolSet:

```python
from composio import ComposioToolSet, App, action

toolset = ComposioToolSet()
```

2. Create a custom action using the `@action` decorator:

### Simple Action Using Existing Tool Authentication

```python
@action(toolname="github")
def get_info_arg(auth: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Get github account information using existing GitHub authentication.

    :param auth: Authentication dictionary provided by Composio for GitHub
    :return info: Github account information
    """
    return auth
```

In this example, the `get_info_arg` function is decorated with `@action(toolname="github")`. This means:
- The function will use the existing authentication for the GitHub tool
- Composio will automatically provide the `auth` dictionary containing the necessary authentication information
- You can obtain the authorized information of your User that has connected their Github under your Integration.

## Executing the Custom Action

```python
print(
    toolset.execute_action(
        action=get_info_arg,
        params={},
    )
)
```

## Getting Authentication Parameters

If you need to retrieve authentication parameters for a specific app, you can use the `get_auth_params` method:

```python
print(
    toolset.get_auth_params(
        app=App.GITHUB,
    )
)
```
