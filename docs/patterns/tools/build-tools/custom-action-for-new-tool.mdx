<Tip>
Custom Actions are powerful building blocks that enable you to create custom functionality while running independently. They can handle everything from simple data processing to complex third-party integrations.

## Creating a Custom Tool without Authentication

<Steps>
<Step title="Import necessary modules">

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio import ComposioToolSet, App, action

toolset = ComposioToolSet()
```
```javascript Javascript
import { OpenAIToolSet } from "composio-core"
import { z } from "zod"

const toolset = new OpenAIToolSet({})
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Creating a custom action">
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
@action(toolname="cow", requires=["cowsay"])
def my_custom_action(message: str) -> str:
    """
    Cow will say whatever you want it to say.

    :param message: Message to be displayed
    :return greeting: Formatted message.
    """
    import cowsay
    
    return cowsay.get_output_string("cow", message)
```
```javascript JavaScript
await toolset.createAction({
    actionName: "myCustomAction",
    description: "Cow will say whatever you want it to say",
    inputParams: z.object({
        message: z.string()
    }),
    callback: async (inputParams) => {
        const message = inputParams.message;
        const cowMessage = `Cow says: ${message}`;
        return cowMessage;
    }
});
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Executing the Custom Action">
Executing the custom action without Agents (it can be used with agents too)
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
toolset.execute_action(
    action=my_custom_action,
    params={"message": "AI is the future"}
)

print(result['data']['greeting'])
```

```javascript JavaScript
console.log(
    await toolset.executeAction(
        "myCustomAction",
        { message: "AI is the future" }
    )
)
```
</CodeGroup>

Output from executing Custom Action
<CodeGroup>
```shell Output (Python)
  ________________
| AI is the future |
  ================
                \
                 \
                   ^__^
                   (oo)\_______
                   (__)\       )\/\
                       ||----w |
                       ||     ||
```
```shell Output (Javascript)
Cow says: AI is the future
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>


### Why Use Custom Tools or Actions?

Custom Tools or Actions provide several advantages:

- **Data privacy:** Execution happens on the user’s machine, ensuring sensitive data doesn’t leave the local environment.
- **Flexibility:** Users can create and customize as many tools and actions as needed.
- **Compatibility:** Custom actions can be integrated seamlessly across various Composio-supported platforms.
