### What are tools?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are like a highly intelligent person who can understand and reason about almost anything but is sitting in an empty room with no ability to interact with the outside world. They can think and talk about sending emails, creating a ticket on Jira, or cloning a repository from github, but can't actually DO these things. 

This is where tools come in. Tools give this intelligent being specific abilities to interact with the real world. Many AI models support tool calling (also called function calling).

<Note>
The term **tools** and **actions** are used interchangeably in the further documentation 
</Note>

### How tool calling works
AI models with tool calling capabilities decide when and how to use specific tools to meet user requests. Developers create and provide these tools, equipping the AI with a toolbox to select the best tool for each task

For example, if a user asks an LLM to send an email to `john@example.com` with subject `Meeting Tomorrow`, the LLM can use the [Gmail](https://app.composio.dev/app/gmail) tool's `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL` action to send the email.

LLM's thinking process:
1. Recognizes this requires email sending capability
2. Identifies the appropriate tool ([Gmail](https://app.composio.dev/app/gmail)) & action (`GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL`)
3. Structures the necessary parameters:
   - recipient: john@example.com
   - subject: "Meeting Tomorrow"
   - body: [drafts appropriate content]
4. Calls the action with these parameters
