### What are Tools?

Tools enable the Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with the real world and perform specific tasks like sending emails, creating tickets on Jira, or cloning a repository from GitHub. Without Tools, LLMs can reason anything but can't perform actions.

Many AI models support tool calling (also known as **function calling**).

  Composio comes with 150+ tools integration like Discord, Slack, GitHub, and
  many more. Check all the tools here

### What are Actions?

Every tool in Composio comes with a set of **tasks** or **actions** that can be used to perform using that tool. For instance, GitHub comes with **"Create an issue"** action, Gmail tool comes with **"Send Email"** action, Slack comes with **"Send message to Slack Channel"** action, and many more.

Every action has an unique **Enum** specified to it. In order to perform an action, we have to specify Enum associated with it. 

### How tool calling works?

AI models with tool calling capabilities decide when and how to use specific tools to meet user requests. Developers create and provide these tools, equipping the AI with a toolbox to select the best tool for each task

For example, if a user asks an LLM to send an email to `john@example.com` with subject `Meeting Tomorrow`, the LLM can use the <Tooltip tip="Tool to send mails">[Gmail](https://app.composio.dev/app/gmail)</Tooltip> tool's <Tooltip tip="Action to send mails via Gmail">`GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL`</Tooltip> action to send the email.

LLM's thinking process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Recognizes this requires email sending capability" />
  <Step title="Identifies the appropriate tool & action">
    For above example, appropriate tool and action will be
    <Tooltip tip="Tool to send mails">[Gmail](https://app.composio.dev/app/gmail)</Tooltip> & <Tooltip tip="Action to send mails via Gmail">`GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL`</Tooltip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Structure the necessary parameters">
    - recipient: john@example.com 
    - subject: "Meeting Tomorrow" 
    - body: [drafts appropriate content]
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calls the action with these parameters" />
</Steps>


### Tool calling with Composio

At Composio, we offer multiple tools that are accessible via Python and JavaScript SDKs.

Within each of these Apps, we provide **Actions**, which are essentially functions that can be executed. For example, you can send an email on [Gmail](https://app.composio.dev/app/gmail), star a repository on [GitHub](https://app.composio.dev/app/github), or create an issue on [Jira](https://app.composio.dev/app/jira).

These tools can also be used directly, similar to function calls, without needing agents.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from composio_langchain import ComposioToolSet, Action, App

tool_set = ComposioToolSet()

# Get all actions from a tool

tools = tool_set.get_tools(apps=[App.GITHUB])

# Get specific actions

tools = tool_set.get_tools(actions=[Action.GITHUB_STAR_A_REPOSITORY_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER])

````

```javascript JavaScript
import { LangchainToolSet } from "composio-core";

const composioToolset = new LangchainToolSet();

// Get all actions from a tool
const tools = await composioToolset.getTools({ apps: ["github"] });

// Get specific actions
const tools = await composioToolset.getTools({ actions: ["GITHUB_STAR_A_REPOSITORY_FOR_THE_AUTHENTICATED_USER"] });

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Action Types">
    1. **External Tool Actions**: Pre-configured actions for specific tools, such as creating issues or changing issue status in Jira.
   2. **System Management Actions**: Actions that interact with the execution environment, like file system operations, shell commands, and browser automation.
   3. **Custom Actions**: User-defined actions in Python or JavaScript that extend Composio's capabilities to interact with new or existing tools.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Action Limits">
   Observed results shows that agents perform optimally when limited to **fewer than 20 actions**. Providing LLMs with too many actions can lead to significant performance issues, such as **increased response time** and **decreased accuracy**.

To optimize agent performance, it's essential to limit the number of actions available. This can be achieved through effective action filtering strategies. Here are some recommended approaches:

1. Use specific actions from a tool
2. Use tags to filter actions
3. Use use-cases to filter actions
4. Implement custom filtering logic

By carefully curating the action set, you can significantly improve agent efficiency and response quality.
