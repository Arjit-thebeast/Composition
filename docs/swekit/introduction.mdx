## Overview

SWE Development Kit (swekit) is a powerful framework for building Software Engineering agents using Composio's tooling ecosystem. 
It provides tools like Github, Repo Indexing, Repo Search, File Manager, Shell Manager, and more.

## Key Features

- **Agent Scaffolding**: Quickly create Devin like agents that work out-of-the-box with popular agentic frameworks like CrewAI, LlamaIndex, and more.
- **Flexible Workspace Environments**: Run your agents in various environments including Docker, E2B, and FlyIO for security and isolation.
- **Customizable Tools**: Add or optimize your agent's abilities with a variety of tools.
- **Benchmarking**: Evaluate your agents against the SWE-bench, a comprehensive benchmark for software engineering tasks.


## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Installation">
  Install the core packages:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Installing SweKit
  pip install swekit composio-core
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  
  Install additional packages for your chosen framework (e.g., CrewAI):
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Installing CrewAI and Composio CrewAI Plugin
  pip install crewai composio-crewai
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect your Github Account">
  In Case, you want to use Github Issues as a source of tasks, you need to connect your Github account.
  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="Composio CLI">
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Use Composio CLI
  composio add github
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Locally using Github Auth Token">
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Use Github Auth Token
  export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_token>
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Step>

<Step title="Create a New Agent">
  Scaffold your agent:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Create a new Folder with basic SWE agent code
  swekit scaffold crewai -o <path>
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  
  This creates a new agent in `<path>/agent` with key files:
  - `main.py`: Entry point to run the agent
  - `agent.py`: Agent definition
  - `prompts.py`: Agent prompts
  - `benchmark.py`: SWE-Bench benchmark runner
</Step>

<Step title="Run the Agent">
  Navigate to the agent directory and run:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Run the agent
  cd <path>/agent
  python main.py
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  
  You'll be prompted for the repository name and issue to work on.
</Step>
</Steps>
