- CTO at X (*Among Top 10 financial advisory firm in Austin, Texas*)

## **Introduction** 

X is on a mission to make investing in assets easier. 
It provides data driven insights into financial markets helping their customerâ€™s make the right investment decisions. 
The company has more than 50 analysts doing extensive research across different verticals and collaborating through different softwares like Notion, Slack, Gmail, etc. 
Research is the core job of the analyst and it involves studying patterns across different documents, 
doing data extraction and then collating insights into reports for decision making. 
Agents to automate and ease the research were planned to be introduced.

### **The challenge**

1. Agent Integrations - Slow development speed and lack of reliability  
2. Auth Management for 100+ employees  
3. Continuously increasing tools to connect

**The Solution**

1. Quick, Easy to implement & configure with support for 150+ tools
2. Function/Tool calling Accuracy optimised for agents 
3. Highly secure with complete data encryption
4. User level Auth Management for even Custom defined Tools

**The Result**

1. Implementation done in 2 days
2. Dramatically improved end user experience 
3. Improved agent accuracy by more than 30%

### Research slowdown at Scale

As the research team grew and began monitoring more domains, they encountered significant challenges. The volume and variety of data overwhelmed them, reducing productivity and efficiency. This strain on resources compromised research quality, leading to delays and missed insights, which hindered decision-making.

To address this, they adopted the OpenAI Assistant framework, aiming to automate routine research tasks and enhance researcher availability. However, they faced issues with reliability, and the accuracy of agent actions dropped to 46% across various tools. To improve versatility and context-awareness, they integrated the agents with key research tools like Slack, Notion, Excel, Bloomberg, and FactSet.

### Rapid Deployment of Agents

The implementation of Composio for Agent was completed in under 6 hours, enabling immediate integration with essential tools like Slack and Notion right out of the box. For additional tools, Composio facilitated seamless authentication management, allowing the team to integrate these tools into their existing systems effortlessly. This swift and efficient setup ensured that no extensive technical knowledge was required, streamlining the process significantly.

### Enhancing Collaboration with Instant Tool Integration

Composio lets developer connect agent's to tools like Slack, Notion, and Gmail easily improving agent's efficiency. By using Composio, tool integration time has dropped from days to hours.

Initially, this rapid integration was met with skepticism. "Our team was astonished at the speed," said the CTO of X. "They thought it was a demo trick."

This improvement has sped up project timelines and increased user engagement with different set of tools. The previously cumbersome process is now a regular, empowering part of the workflow, enabling rapid access and sharing of insights.

Composio also ensures robust security, allowing teams to focus on their research without concern for integration mechanics.

With successful initial integrations, X has begun incorporating more complex tools through Composio.
