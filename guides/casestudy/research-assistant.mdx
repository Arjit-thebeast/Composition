## **Introduction** 

ABC aims to simplify asset investing by offering data-driven financial market insights, enabling customers to make informed investment choices. With over 50 analysts conducting research across various verticals and collaborating via tools like Notion, Slack, and Gmail, the company places research at the core of its operations. Analysts study patterns in documents, extract data, and compile insights into decision-making reports. To streamline the research process, ABC plans to introduce automation agents designed to enhance efficiency and ease the workload of its analysts.

### **The challenge**

1. Agent Integrations - Slow development speed and lack of reliability  
2. Auth Management for 100+ employees  
3. Continuously increasing tools to connect

**The Solution**

1. Quick, Easy to implement & configure with support for 150+ tools
2. Function/Tool calling Accuracy optimised for agents 
3. Highly secure with complete data encryption
4. User level Auth Management for even Custom defined Tools

**The Result**

1. Implementation done in 2 days
2. Dramatically improved end user experience 
3. Improved agent accuracy by more than 30%

### Research slowdown at Scale

As the research team grew and began monitoring more domains, they encountered significant challenges. The volume and variety of data overwhelmed them, reducing productivity and efficiency. This strain on resources compromised research quality, leading to delays and missed insights, which hindered decision-making.

To address this, they adopted the OpenAI Assistant framework, aiming to automate routine research tasks and enhance researcher availability. However, they faced issues with reliability, and the accuracy of agent actions dropped to 46% across various tools. To improve versatility and context-awareness, they integrated the agents with key research tools like Slack, Notion, Excel, Bloomberg, and FactSet.

### Rapid Deployment of Agents

The implementation of Composio for Agent was completed in under 6 hours, enabling immediate integration with essential tools like Slack and Notion right out of the box. For additional tools, Composio facilitated seamless authentication management, allowing the team to integrate these tools into their existing systems effortlessly. This swift and efficient setup ensured that no extensive technical knowledge was required, streamlining the process significantly.

### Enhancing Collaboration with Instant Tool Integration

Composio enables developers connect agents to tools like Slack, Notion and Gmail, significantly improving agent's efficiency. By leveraging Composio, tool integration time dropped from days to hours.

Initially, this rapid integration was met with skepticism. "Our team was astonished by the speed," said the CTO of X. "They thought it was a demo trick."

This improvement has sped up project timelines and increased user engagement with different set of tools. The previously cumbersome process is now a regular, empowering part of the workflow, enabling rapid access and sharing of insights.

With successful initial integrations, X begun incorporating more complex tools through Composio.
