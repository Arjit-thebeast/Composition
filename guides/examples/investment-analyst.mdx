<Steps>
    <Step title= "Install required packages">
    First, let's install the necessary packages and connect your SERPAPI account using composio cli so agents can use it. Run the following commands on your terminal:
    <CodeGroup>
        ```bash Run Command
        pip install composio-langchain
        pip install composio-core
        pip install langchain-community
        pip install huggingface_hub
        pip install google-search-results

        # Connect your serpapi account so agents can use it.

        composio add serpapi
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Imports and Environment Setup">
    In your Python script, import the necessary libraries and set up your environment variables.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Import statements
        from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
        from composio_langchain import ComposioToolSet, Action, App
        from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
        import os
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Initialise tools and agents">
    Initialize the tools and agents required for the system. Make sure to set the SERPAPI_API_KEY environment variable with your API key.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Tools and Agents
        os.environ["SERPAPI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("SERPAPI_API_KEY")

        # Initialize the language model
        llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
        model="gemini-pro", verbose=True, temperature=0.9, google_api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
        )

        # Define tools for the agents
        composio_toolset = ComposioToolSet()
        tools = composio_toolset.get_actions(actions=[Action.SERPAPI_SEARCH])

        ```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

   <Step title="Defining the Agent">
   Define the roles and goals of our agents. There are four agents in use here: Investment Researcher, Investment Analyst, and Investment Recommender agents.
   <CodeGroup>
       ```python Agents
        # Define the Investment Researcher agent
        researcher = Agent(
            role='Investment Researcher',
            goal='Use SERP to research the top 2 results based on the input given to you and provide a report',
            backstory="""
            You are an expert Investment researcher. Using the information given to you, conduct comprehensive research using
            various sources and provide a detailed report. Don't pass in location as an argument to the tool
            """,
            verbose=True,
            allow_delegation=True,
            tools=tools,
            llm=llm
        )
        # Define the Investment Analyst agent
        analyser = Agent(
            role='Investment Analyst',
            goal='Analyse the stock based on information available to it, use all the tools',
            backstory="""
            You are an expert Investment Analyst. You research on the given topic and analyse your research for insights.
            Note: Do not use SERP when you're writing the report
            """,
            verbose=True,
            tools=tools,
            llm=llm
        )

        # Define the Investment Recommender agent
        recommend = Agent(
            role='Investment Recommendation',
            goal='Based on the analyst insights, you offer recommendations',
            backstory="""
            You are an expert Investment Recommender. You understand the analyst insights and with your expertise suggest and offer
            advice on whether to invest or not. List the Pros and Cons as bullet points
            """,
            verbose=True,
            tools=tools,
            llm=llm
        )

        ```

   </CodeGroup>
   </Step>

    <Step title="Defining the Task and Kickoff the Process">
    Create a task for the analyst agent and execute the process.
    <CodeGroup>
        ```python Execute
        # Get user input for the research topic
        user_input = input("Please provide a topic: ")

        # Define the task for the analyst agent
        analyst_task = Task(
            description=f'Research on {user_input}',
            agent=analyser,
            expected_output="When the input is well researched, thoroughly analysed and recommendation is offered"
        )

        # Create the crew with the defined agents and task
        investment_crew = Crew(
            agents=[researcher, analyser, recommend],
            tasks=[analyst_task],
            verbose=1,
            full_output=True,
        )

        # Execute the process

        res = investment_crew.kickoff()

        ```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
