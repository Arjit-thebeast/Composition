Let's get you started building with Composio! You should be familiar with core concepts of Composio Platform to best utilise it. 

Goal of this section is to give you a brief walkthrough of each component and how they go together. 

| Component          | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Tools/Apps         | Tools or Apps refer to the various applications or tools that can be integrated and used by your agents via Composio. |
| Integrations       | Integrations allow users to connect external accounts, like Salesforce, to Composio. New Integrations can be built by using default credentials or registering a new developer app & deciding on auth permissions|
| ConnectedAccounts  | Connected accounts represent user-specific instances of integrations, storing credentials and specific configuration details. |
| Actions            | Actions are tasks that can be performed by your agents. ex. `send email via gmail` |
| Triggers           | Triggers are predefined conditions that, when met, initiate webhooks to your agents. |
| Entity             | Entity is a catch all term for your users who can be individuals, entities, teams, organisations. Composio manages authentication at `Entity` level. |

In next few pages, we can go through each component in detail. They will explain how to use each component in the code and what the expected flow should look like.
