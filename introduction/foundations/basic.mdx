Let's get you started building with Composio! You should be familiar with core concepts of Composio Platform to best utilise it.

Goal of this section is to give you a brief walkthrough of each component and how they go together.

| Component         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Tools/Apps        | Tools or Apps refer to the various applications or tools that can be integrated and used by your agents via Composio.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Integrations      | Integrations are tool configurations (eg. Permissions to ask for when connecting an account, ClientID/Secret in the case of OAuth) that will be used to connect your users account to Composio. You can use your own configuration or use Composio's default integrations. |
| ConnectedAccounts | Connected accounts represent connections between your app and third-party platforms. They are user-specific instances of integrations, storing credentials and specific configuration details.                                                                             |
| Actions           | Actions are tasks that can be performed by your agents. ex. `send email via gmail`                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Triggers          | Triggers are predefined conditions that, when met, initiate webhooks to your agents.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Entity            | Entity is a catch all term for your users who can be individuals, entities, teams, organisations. Composio manages authentication at `Entity` level.                                                                                                                       |

In next few pages, we can go through each component in detail. They will explain how to use each component in the code and what the expected flow should look like.
