## Using Actions

**Prerequisite**: Successfully **linking an account** & then having `connectedAccountId`.

## **Understanding Connected Accounts**

Connected Accounts are established **links** between **Composio** and an **external application**, created during the **user authentication process**.

They **store authentication details** such as **access tokens** and **refresh tokens**.

## **Types of Actions**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Default Actions">
    Composio supports a variety of default actions for each supported
    application.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom Actions">
    Our platform offers an extensible interface for defining custom actions for
    both custom and default applications. [Learn more.](https://app.composio.dev/apps/custom)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local Code/Local Actions">
    Composio enables fetching authentication parameters for any connection,
    allowing you to execute code remotely and interact with API endpoints.
    Example: Use the `getConnection` endpoint to call GitHub, create an issue on
    your server, and fetch the access token. [Learn more](https://docs.composio.dev/actions/local-code)

## Working with Actions

<Steps>
<Step title="Fetch Actions">

<CodeGroup>
```python Get Action/s Input Schema

from composio import Composio

composio = Composio("api-key")

print(composio.get_list_of_actions(action_names = [Action.GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE]))

print(composio.get_list_of_actions())

```
</CodeGroup>

The response will include the **Action's ID, Name and Input/Output schema** in **JSON Def**

<CodeGroup>
```JSON Sample Response
[
  {
    "name": "github_create_issue",
    "display_name": "Create Issue",

    "appName": "Github",
    "enabled": true
  }
]
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Execute the action">
<CodeGroup>
```python Execute Action

# Get connected Account

connected_account = composio.get_connected_account(connection_id="Account_ID")

# Ideally this will be decided by LLM using something like function calling

params = { "repo":"speedy", "owner":"utkarsh-dixit", 
"title":"Too much light","body":"Show my dark night"}

# Execute the Action

execution_details = connected_account.execute_action(action_name=Action.GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE, input_data=params)

```
</CodeGroup>
When executed successfully, action's response will be output. Output schema as returned by the /actions endpoint.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Retrieving All Supported Actions with Composio

<CodeGroup>
```python Different Methods to Get All Actions
composio.getAllTools(uuid) # pick all Tools that are relevant for user.
connected_account.get_all_actions() # Get all tools from connection
```

</CodeGroup>
This approach ensures that users can easily discover and utilize the full range of actions available to them, enhancing their integration and automation capabilities.
