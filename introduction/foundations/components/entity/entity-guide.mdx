## Introduction to Entities

In Composio, an entity represents either a user or an organization, encapsulating all associated accounts under a single management umbrella. This consolidation simplifies the administration of multiple accounts.

## Make your user do a task on Github
<CodeGroup>
```python Default Imports
from composio import Composio, App
from openai import OpenAI


client = Composio('api-key')
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="******OPENAIKEY******")
```
</CodeGroup>

Let's create an entity for a user via their email. Email is just an example, you can use any unique identifier for the entity.

<CodeGroup>
```python Create or get an entity
entity = client.get_entity('user_email_id') 
```
</CodeGroup>

Now, let's get the connected account for the entity. If the connected account does not exist, let's get the user to connect their account.

<CodeGroup>
```python Get connected account
if entity.is_app_authenticated(App.GITHUB) == False: 
    request = entity.initiate_connection(app_name = App.GITHUB)   
    print("Complete the auth flow, link: ", request.redirectUrl)
    ## Step 3
    #Keep Polling and wait until timeout
    connected_account = request.wait_until_active(timeout=60)
else:
    print("Already connected to GitHub")
    connected_account = entity.get_active_connection(app_name = App.GITHUB)
```
</CodeGroup>

Now, let's get all the actions that can be performed on the entity on GitHub. You can avoid filtering via Github if you want to see all the actions.
<CodeGroup>
```python Get all actions
actions = entity.get_actions(app_name = App.GITHUB)
```
</CodeGroup>

Now, let's call our agent for this entity to perform the task on Github on behalf of the user.

<CodeGroup>
```python Agent Execution
my_task = "Star a repo SamparkAI/composio_sdk on GitHub"

response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
tools=actions, # Passing actions we fetched earlier.
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": my_task}
  ]
)

# Execute Function calls
execution_details = connected_account.handle_tools_calls(response)

print(execution_details)
```
</CodeGroup>

You can use the above pattern to make agents at a user level to perform tasks on their behalf.
