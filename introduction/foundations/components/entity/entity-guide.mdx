## Introduction to Entities

In Composio, an entity represents either a user or an organization, encapsulating all associated accounts under a single management umbrella. 
This consolidation simplifies the administration of multiple accounts.


## Make your user do a task on Github
<CodeGroup>
```python Default Imports
from composio import Composio, App
from openai import OpenAI

composio_client = Composio(api_key="COMPOSIO_API_KEY")
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="******OPENAIKEY******")
```
</CodeGroup>

Let's create an entity for a user via their email. Email is just an example, you can use any unique identifier for the entity.

<CodeGroup>
```python Create or get an entity
entity = composio_client.get_entity(id='user_email_id') 
```
</CodeGroup>

Now, let's get the connected account for the entity. If the connected account does not exist, let's get the user to connect their account.

<CodeGroup>
```python Get connected account
try:
    connected_account  = entity.get_connection(app="slack")
except Exception as e:
    print("No connected account found")
```
</CodeGroup>

Now, let's get all the actions that can be performed on the entity on GitHub. You can avoid filtering via Github if you want to see all the actions.
<CodeGroup>
```python Get all actions
actions = entity.get_actions(app_name = App.GITHUB)
```
</CodeGroup>

Now, let's call our agent for this entity to perform the task on Github on behalf of the user.

<CodeGroup>
```python Agent Execution
from composio_openai import ComposioToolSet, Action, App
from openai import OpenAI

openai_client = OpenAI()
# can be configured to use the entity id of the user
tool_set = ComposioToolSet(entity_id="melissa") 
actions = tool_set.get_tools(apps=[App.GITHUB])

my_task = "Star a repo SamparkAI/composio on GitHub"

response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
    tools=actions,  # Passing actions we fetched earlier.
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": my_task},
    ],
)
tool_set.handle_tool_calls(response=response, entity_id="melissa")
```
</CodeGroup>

You can use the above pattern to make agents at a user level to perform tasks on their behalf.
