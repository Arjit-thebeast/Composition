## Steps to Connect a Customer's Account

### 1. Gather Integration Parameters

<Steps>
<Step title="Gather Integration Parameters">

Ex API Key , Sub Domain URL, User Name

<CodeGroup>
```python Printing Required Params
from composio import Composio

client = Composio("api-key")

# Integration Chosen by User to Connect with

integration = client.get_integration(integration_id)

# list of params req from user

print(integration.get_required_variables())

````
</CodeGroup>

Response if `Zendesk` Integration was chosen.
<CodeGroup>
```json Example Response
[
  {
    "name": "subdomain",
    "expected_from_customer": true,
    "displayName": "Zendesk Subdomain",
    "description": "Your Zendesk subdomain (e.g., your-company-name in your-company-name.zendesk.com)",
    "type": "string",
    "required": true
  }
]
````

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Initiate Connection Request">

<CodeGroup>
```python Send Requested Params
# Collect the subdomain from your user via your platform's frontend
params = {"subdomain":"***zendesk_sub_domain****"}

connection_request = integration.initiate_connection(params=params, entity_id = "")

if connection_request.redirectUrl != "":
print("Please complete the auth flow by opening this link: ", connection_request.redirectUrl)
else:
print("The account status is: ",connection_request)

````
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Authorisation Flow Redirect (Optional)">

In case of **OAuth Flow**, _redirectUrl_ will be returned.

<Tip>
Redirect User for OAuth Authorisation Completion page.
</Tip>

On approval, User will be redirected back to configured URL.

<CodeGroup>
```python Example Connection Request
{
    "connectionStatus": "INITIATED",
    "connectedAccountId": "1f32dbf-f7cfec95e567",
    "redirectUrl": "https://ghghghh.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new?client_id=test_aa&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fbackend.composio.dev%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fauth"
}
````

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Validate Connection Request">

Check if the status has been updated.

<AccordionGroup title="Get Status of Connection Request">
<Accordion title="Fetch ConnectedAccount">
Get Connected Account using ID & Verify value of status
<CodeGroup>
```python Get Connected Account Object
connected_account = composio.get_connected_account(connection_request.id)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Poll using `Wait` Method">
<CodeGroup>
```python Polling until Expiry
connected_account = connection_request.wait_until_active(timeout=60)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
Print Status 
<CodeGroup>
```python Print ConnectedAccount Status
print(connected_account.status)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>

We created a new Connected Account.

You should be able to use `connected_account.id` to execute actions or receive triggers.
