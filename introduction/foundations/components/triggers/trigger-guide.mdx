## Using Triggers

**Prerequisite**: Successfully **linking an account** & then having `connectedAccountId`.

## **Types of Triggers**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Default Triggers (Preferred)">
    Composio supports a variety of default triggers for each supported
    application. Check them out by going to the app page.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom Triggers (Build your Own)">
    Our platform offers an extensible interface for defining custom triggers for
    both custom and default applications. [**Coming Soon**](#)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Listing Default Triggers

<CodeGroup>
``` python Code for Get List of Triggers
from composio import Composio

composio_client = Composio("api-key")

print(composio_client.get_list_of_triggers())

```
</CodeGroup>

The response will include the trigger‚Äôs config/payload schema in a JSON compatible manner. It will also contain metadata like trigger name, ID. 

<CodeGroup>
```JSON Response for Get Triggers 
[
    {
        "name": "github_pull_request_event",
        "display_name": "Pull Request Event",
        "description": "Triggered when a pull request is opened, closed, or synchronized.",
        "payload": {
            "properties": {
                "action": {
                    "description": "The action that was performed on the pull request",
                    ...
                }...
            }...
            "type": "object"
        },
        "config": {
            "properties": {
                "owner": {
                    "description": "Owner of the repository",
                    ...
                }...
            },
            "required": [
                "owner"...
            ],
            "title": "WebhookConfigSchema",
            "type": "object"
        },
        ...
        "enabled": true
    }...
]
```
</CodeGroup>

## Setting Up Triggers

To set up triggers, follow these steps:

1. **Set Universal Callback URL**: Define a universal callback URL to receive payloads for all your triggers. You can set this URL through the [settings](https://app.composio.dev/api_keys) or by using the API endpoint `api/v1/triggers/setCallbackURL`.

2. **Review Trigger Instructions**: Each trigger may have specific instructions. For example, in Slack, you need to configure our webhook URL in the OAuth app settings.

3. **Enable Trigger for Connected Account**: Use the trigger's configuration schema to enable the webhook URL for a specific connected account. This is done via the API endpoint `api/v1/triggers/enable/{connected_account_id}/{trigger_id}`. The request body should include `{"triggerConfig": {} }`, with all the necessary values as per the trigger's configuration schema. For example, for a GitHub repository webhook, the configuration might look like this:

<CodeGroup>
``` JSON API to get required trigger parameters
"triggerConfig": {
	  "owner": "kaavee315",
	  "repo": "ML_assignment"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Handling Triggers 

After completing the setup, the specified webhook URL will begin to receive data. 

This data includes the `connected_account_id` for account identification, `trigger_id` for trigger identification, and the `payload`, which adheres to the trigger's specified payload schema.
<CodeGroup>
``` JSON Sample Trigger Webhook, Received on Callback URL
{
	"trigger_name":"github_commit_event",
    "trigger_id":"12310-sadas-12ad-sa",
	"connected_account_id":"64184e1a-76bf-404b-bf8e-e9ce04fd7c9c",
	"payload":{
