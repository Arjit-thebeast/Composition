# Using Integrations

### **Integrations**

An Integration allows your users to connect with various external applications and authorise your agents to act on behalf of them.

### **Decide on what kind of Integrations you want**

1. **Default Integrations**: We support many applications and you can easily create integrations for them. You can also add your client ID and Secret. [List of available integrations.](https://www.notion.so/Introduction-27b3883644704d55812a8da65b405f32?pvs=21)
2. **Custom Integrations**: We also allow you to define custom integrations through code. This is done by adding a YAML file.
3. **Premium Integrations:** We can also prioritise specialised integrations for your use case.

### **Connecting your customerâ€™s account**

### Step 1: Get all required parameters for an integration

Ex API Key , Sub Domain URL, User Name

```python
from composio.sdk import ComposioSdk

composio = Composio("api-key")

integration = composio.get_integration(integration_id) # User Selected Id

print(integration.get_required_variables()) # list of params req from user
```

Printed for `Zendesk`

```python
[
    {
        'name': 'api_key',
        'expected_from_customer': True,
        'displayName': 'API Key',
        'description': 'Your Linear API key for authentication. Obtain it from your Linear settings.',
        'type': 'string',
        'required': True
    }
]
```

### Step 2: Initiate a Connection Request by using collecting params via user

```python
params = {"api_key":"linearApiKey"}

connection_request = integration.initiate_connection(user_uuid = nil, params=params)
print(connection_request)
if connection_request.redirectUrl != "":
	print(f"Please complete the auth flow by opening this link: {}", connection_request.redirectUrl)
else:
	print("The account status is :{}",connection_request.status)
```

### Step 3: Complete the redirectUrl Flow allowing user to authorise the request

In case of **OAuth Flow**, the _redirectUrl_ will be returned which will be used to redirect User to OAuth Authorisation Completion page.

```python
{
    "connectionStatus": "INITIATED",
    "connectedAccountId": "1f32dbf-f7cfec95e567",
    "redirectUrl": "https://ghghghh.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new?client_id=test_aa&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fbackend.composio.dev%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fauth"
}
```

Once user approves, OAuth process will be completed and the user will be redirected back to configured URL in the connector.

### **Step 4: Get Status of Connection Request**

Check if the status has been updated. You can do it via two different ways

1. Get Connected Account using ID & Verify value of status

   OR

2. Use `wait_until_active` method.

```python
account = composio.get_connected_account(connection_request.id)
print(account.status)

# OR

account = connection_request.wait_until_active(timeout=60)
print(account)
```
