## Goal: Star a repository on GitHub with natural language

<Steps> 
<Step title="Setting Up GitHub Integration">
<Tabs>
<Tab title="Continue with defauly Integration">
This is the easiest way to start. Just use `TestIntegration.AppName` to use default integrations.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Create your Integration">
For creating your own integration, you will have to register a developer app on github and use credentials like `client_id` and `client_secret`.

Complete instructions can be found at [Github App Docs](https://docs.composio.dev/apps/github)

After you have created your integration, _Copy your integration ID_

</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step title="Authenticating Github">
<CodeGroup>
```bash Install Composio SDK 
pip install composio-core
```
</CodeGroup>
Use `Github Integration` to Connect your `Github Account`

Modify _Composio_ `api-key` by [creating your own](https://app.composio.dev/api_keys).

<Tip> TestIntegration.*App* uses Composio built-in Integrations </Tip>
<CodeGroup>
```python Auth via OAuth 
from composio import Composio, TestIntegration

client = Composio("api-key")

#client.get_integration(**YourIntegrationID**)
integration = client.get_integration(TestIntegration.GITHUB)

#Trying to initiate a new connection
connected_account = integration.initiate_connection(entity_id = None)

print("Complete the auth flow, link: ", connected_account.redirectUrl)

````

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Wait for Connected Account Status to be 'Active'">
  If you havenâ€™t, please click on redirectUrl above and complete the flow.
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Connected Account Polling
    #Keep Polling and wait until timeout
    connected_account = connected_account.wait_until_active(timeout=60)
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Supported Actions">
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Fetch Actions
    actions = connected_account.get_all_actions()
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Using Function Call">
Modify `OPENAIKEY` before executing it.
<CodeGroup>
```python Task to Action Selection
from openai import OpenAI

my_task = "Star a repo SamparkAI/docs on GitHub"

# Initialize the OpenAI client with your API key
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="******OPENAIKEY******")

# Create a chat completion request to decide on the action
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
tools=actions, # Passing actions we fetched earlier.
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": my_task}
  ]
)
````

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Handle Tool Calls - Execute Actions">
<CodeGroup>
```python Executing Selected Actions!
# Execute Function calls
execution_details = connected_account.handle_tools_calls(response)

print(execution_details)

print("Completed Task")

````

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Putting it all together

<CodeGroup>
```python Complete Code
## Step 1
#!pip install composio-core

## Step 2
from openai import OpenAI
from composio import Composio, TestIntegration

# Initialize the OpenAI client with your API key
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="******OPENAIKEY******")
client = Composio("api-key")

#client.get_integration(**YourIntegrationID**)
integration = client.get_integration(TestIntegration.GITHUB)

#Trying to initiate a new connection
connected_account = integration.initiate_connection(entity_id = None)

print("Complete the auth flow, link: ", connected_account.redirectUrl)

## Step 3
#Keep Polling and wait until timeout
connected_account = connected_account.wait_until_active(timeout=60)

## Step 4
actions = connected_account.get_all_actions()

## Step 5
my_task = "Star a repo SamparkAI/docs on GitHub"



# Create a chat completion request to decide on the action
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
tools=actions, # Passing actions we fetched earlier.
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": my_task}
  ]
)

## Step 6
# Execute Function calls
execution_details = connected_account.handle_tools_calls(response)

print(execution_details)

print("Completed Task")
