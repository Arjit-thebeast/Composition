description: "Use Composio to connect OpenAI Assistant to GitHub (via OAUTH2) to perform a task using natural language"
---

## Goal: Star a repository on GitHub with natural language

<Steps>

<Step title="Install Composio Package">
<CodeGroup>
```bash Install Composio SDK 
pip install composio-core -U
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step>

Modify _Composio_ `api-key` by [creating your own](https://app.composio.dev/api_keys).

<CodeGroup>
```python Auth via OAuth 
from composio import Composio, App

client = Composio("api-key")

# Authenticate a particular user

# Feel free to keep user_id anything if you are testing.

my_user = client.get_entity(entity_id="user_id")

#Trying to initiate a new connection
connected_account = my_user.initiate_connection(app_name=App.GITHUB)

print("Complete the auth flow, link: ", connected_account.redirectUrl)

```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Wait for Connected Account Status to be 'Active'">
  If you havenâ€™t, please click on redirectUrl above and complete the flow.
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Connected Account Polling
    #Keep Polling and wait until timeout
    connected_account = connected_account.wait_until_active(timeout=60)
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="List all Supported Actions">
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Fetch Actions
    actions = connected_account.get_all_actions()
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Using Function Call">
Modify `OPENAIKEY` before executing it.
<CodeGroup>
```python Task to Action Selection
from openai import OpenAI

my_task = "Star a repo SamparkAI/composio_sdk on GitHub"

# Initialize the OpenAI client
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="******OPENAIKEY******")

# Create a chat completion request to decide on the action
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
tools=actions, # Passing actions we fetched earlier.
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": my_task}
  ]
)
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Handle Tool Calls - Execute Actions">
<CodeGroup>
```python Executing Selected Actions!
# Execute Function calls
execution_details = connected_account.handle_tools_calls(response)

print(execution_details)

print("Completed Task")

```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Putting it all together

Replace `OPENAIKEY` and `api-key` below.

<CodeGroup>
```python Complete Code
## Step 1
#!pip install composio-core -U

## Step 2
from openai import OpenAI
from composio import Composio,App

# Initialize the OpenAI client
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="******OPENAIKEY******")
client = Composio("api-key")


my_user = client.get_entity(entity_id="user_id")
#Trying to initiate a new connection
connected_account = my_user.initiate_connection(app_name=App.GITHUB)

print("Complete the auth flow, link: ", connected_account.redirectUrl)

## Step 3
#Keep Polling and wait until timeout
connected_account = connected_account.wait_until_active(timeout=60)

## Step 4
actions = connected_account.get_all_actions()

## Step 5
my_task = "Star a repo SamparkAI/composio_sdk on GitHub"



# Create a chat completion request to decide on the action
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
tools=actions, # Passing actions we fetched earlier.
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": my_task}
  ]
)

## Step 6
# Execute Function calls
execution_details = connected_account.handle_tools_calls(response)

print(execution_details)

print("Completed Task")
```
