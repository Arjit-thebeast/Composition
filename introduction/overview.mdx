  multitude of tools, enabling your agents to perform actions across tools.
</Tip>

## Try Composio in under 5 mins.

Your one-stop platform for agent-tool interactions. Composio handles Authentication, Action Execution, Trigger Management, and Function Calling seamlessly.

<Tip>Goal: Perform actions on GitHub with Composio + Function Calling</Tip>

<Steps> 
<Step title="Setting Up GitHub Integration">
<AccordionGroup title="Select the option that suits you best.">
<Accordion title="Use your Github registered Developer App">
[Register your own Integration](https://docs.composio.dev/apps/github) _Copy your integration ID._
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Use Pre-configured App (Preferred)">
Please use `TestIntegration.GITHUB` for quick Setup 
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Authenticating Github">
<CodeGroup>
```bash Install Composio SDK 
pip install composio-core
```
</CodeGroup>
Use Github Integration 
<CodeGroup>
```python Auth via OAuth 
from composio import Composio, TestIntegration, SchemaFormat

client = Composio("api-key") # init

integration = client.get_integration(TestIntegration.GITHUB) # Modify

#Trying to initiate a new connection
connection_request = integration.initiate_connection(user_uuid = None)

print("Complete the auth flow, link: ", connection_request.redirectUrl)

```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Wait for Connection">
  If you havenâ€™t, please click on redirectUrl above and complete the flow.
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Connection Request Polling
    #Keep Polling and wait until timeout
    connected_account = connection_request.wait_until_active(timeout=60)
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Supported Actions">
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Fetch Actions
    #Get based on Connected Account, Format
    actions = connected_account.get_all_actions(format=SchemaFormat.OPENAI)

    print(actions)
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Using Function Call">
<CodeGroup>
```python Task to Action Selection
from openai import OpenAI

my_task = "Star a repo SamparkAI/custom-auth-integrations on GitHub"

# Initialize the OpenAI client with your API key
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="******OPENAIKEY******")

# Create a chat completion request to decide on the action
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
tools=actions, # Passing actions we fetched earlier.
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": my_task}
  ]
)
```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Handle Tool Calls - Execute Actions">
<CodeGroup>
```python Executing Selected Actions!
# Execute Function calls
execution_details = connected_account.handle_tools_calls(response)

print(execution_details)

print("Completed Task")

```

</CodeGroup>
