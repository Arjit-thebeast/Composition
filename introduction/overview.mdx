<Tip>ðŸ’¡ Goal: Perform actions on GitHub with Composio + Function Calling</Tip>

<Steps> 
<Step title="Setting Up GitHub Integration">

- Option 1: [Register your own GitHub Developer App](https://www.notion.so/Quick-Start-56eb47b13a04429f85a3f2195ac4f2de?pvs=21)
- Option 2: Use our pre-configured integration (Recommended for quick setup)

Select the option that suits you best. Remember to note down your integration ID from the dashboard if you opt for creating your own.

</Step>

<Step title="Authenticating Github">

<CodeGroup>
```python Use OAuth To Authenticate Github
from composio import Composio, TestIntegration, SchemaFormat

client = Composio("api-key") # init

integration = client.get_app_integration(TestIntegration.GITHUB) # OAUTH 2

#Trying to initiate a new connection
connection_request = integration.initiate_connection(user_id = None)

print("Complete the auth flow, link: ", connection_request.redirectUrl)

````

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Wait until Account is Connected">
  If you havenâ€™t, please click on redirectUrl above and complete the flow.
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Waiting For Auth Flow Completion
    #Keep Polling and wait until timeout
    connected_account = connection_request.wait_until_active(timeout=60)
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Get Supported Actions">
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Fetch Available Actions
    #Get all actions based on scope, integration for connected account
    actions = connected_account.get_all_actions(format=SchemaFormat.OPENAI)

    print(actions)
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Use Function Call">
<CodeGroup>
```python Use Function Calling
from openai import OpenAI

my_task = "Star a repo SamparkAI/custom-auth-integrations on GitHub"

# Initialize the OpenAI client with your API key
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="\***\*\*\*\***OPENAIKEY\***\*\*\*\*\***")

# Create a chat completion request to decide on the action
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
tools=actions, # Passing actions we fetched earlier.
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": my_task}
  ]
)
````

</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Handle Tool Calls - Execute Actions">
<CodeGroup>
```python Executing Function Call Action!
# Execute Function calls
execution_details = connected_account.handle_tools_calls(response)

print(execution_details)

print("Completed Task")

```

</CodeGroup>
</Step>
