## Welcome to Composio

Your one-stop platform for agent-tool interactions. Composio handles Authentication, Action Execution, Trigger Management, and Function Calling seamlessly.

## Experience Composio in Action

<Tip>ðŸ’¡ Goal: Perform actions on GitHub with Composio + Function Calling</Tip>

### Step 1: Setting Up GitHub Integration

- Option 1: [Register your own GitHub Developer App](https://www.notion.so/Quick-Start-56eb47b13a04429f85a3f2195ac4f2de?pvs=21)
- Option 2: Use our pre-configured integration (Recommended for quick setup)

Select the option that suits you best. Remember to note down your integration ID from the dashboard if you opt for creating your own.

### **Step 2: Authenticating Github**

```python
from composio import Composio, TestIntegration, SchemaFormat

composio_client = Composio("api-key")

integration = composio_client.get_app_integration(TestIntegration.GITHUB)

#print(integration.get_required_variables())

# OAUTH 2 flow
connection_request = integration.initiate_connection(user_id = None)
print(f"Please complete the auth flow by opening this link: {connection_request.redirectUrl}")
```

### **Step 2.5: Wait until Account is Connected**

If you havenâ€™t, please click on redirectUrl above and complete the flow.

```python
connected_account = connection_request.wait_until_active(timeout=60)
```

### Step 3: Get All Actions

```python
actions = connected_account.get_all_actions(format=SchemaFormat.OPENAI)
```

### **Step 4: Using OpenAI Function Call -** Creating an Issue on Github

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="*********OPENAIKEY**********")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
tools=actions,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a good assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Create a new issue in a repository and title it 'This is so cool!', \
and the body of the issue is 'Does it work? Lets try.'. \
The owner of the repository is utkarsh-dixit and name of the repository is speedy",
        }
    ]
)
```

### Step 5: Handle Tool Calls - Execute Actions

```python
# All function calls can be executed together.
execution_details = connected_account.handle_tools_calls(response)

if execution_details[0]['execution_details']['executed'] {
	print("created issue")
}
```
