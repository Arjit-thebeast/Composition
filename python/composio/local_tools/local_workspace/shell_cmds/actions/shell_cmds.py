      In general if you want to run any other command directly on shell, use this action.
      Few examples:
      1 - If you want to run python script, use this tool to run the python script. *NOTE* : while running a script, give complete path of the script.
      2 - Or if you want to `ls -a` use this tool to run the command.

    You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands.
    If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!
    You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
    However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.
    Never issue a find command against "/" directory. It will not work. Always try to find files within the base directory given in the task.
