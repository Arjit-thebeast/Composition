Using the CLI, you can establish new connections to applications such as GitHub, Linear, Notion, Gmail, and more.
These connections enable your agents to perform various actions on your behalf.

### Managing Connections

<Steps>
<Step title="Show All Supported Apps">
**View all supported tools/apps** with Composio.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Show all Apps
  composio apps
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Connecting your preferred tool to Composio">
**Authorise your app account** to enable agent to interact using your account.
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Authorise Slack
  composio add slack # Replace 'slack' with any supported app
  
  #composio add github || composio add linear || composio add notion 
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  After completing the authorisation, a new `connected_account` will be created and visible in your dashboard.
