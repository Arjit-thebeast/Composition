Some of the Composio tools have more than 100 actions. We know the accuracy of the agents decreases when they have to choose from a large number of actions. 
<Info>In practical scenarios, agents perform optimally when limited to a maximum of 10-20 actions. </Info>
So, we need to reduce the number of actions to be passed to the agents. To encounter this, we can filter actions by various ways.

### Filter actions by tags
Instead of passing all the actions of an app to the agent, we can filter the actions by relevant tags. 
We provide the tags enum in the composio library making it easy to filter actions by tags. 
2 common enums across apps: `Tag.ALL` and `Tag.IMPORTANT`.
Other enums are specific to the app. For example, `Tag.ASANA_TASKS` for Asana app.
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Asana actions by tasks tag to only get tasks related actions
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
toolsAsanaGithub = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ASANA], tags=[Tag.ASANA_TASKS])
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
    If you don't pass the tags, Composio only passes important actions of the app to avoid agent failing. This is not recommended to be used in production.
</Warning>

<Info>
    If you want to get all the actions for an app, you can pass Tag.ALL to the tags parameter.
</Info>

### Filter actions by specific actions
If you want to restrict agents from using specific actions, you can filter the actions by specific actions.
<Note> To get list of actions for a use case/power you want to give to the agent, you can use `composio-cli get-actions` command. Check the [actions](/sdk/cli/actions) section for more details.</Note>
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Github Create Issue action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
toolsGithubCreateIssue = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE])
```
</CodeGroup>
