## Using Triggers

**Prerequisite**: Successfully **linking an account** & then having `connectedAccountId`.

## **Understanding Connected Accounts**

Connected Accounts are established **links** between **Composio** and an **external application**, created during the **user authentication process**.

They **store authentication details** such as **access tokens** and **refresh tokens**. [Read more](https://docs.composio.dev/integrations/integration-guide)

## **Types of Triggers**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Option 1Ô∏è‚É£ Default Triggers (Preferred)">
    Composio supports a variety of default triggers for each supported
    application. Check them out by going to the app page. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Option 2Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Triggers (Build your Own)">
    Our platform offers an extensible interface for defining custom triggers for
    both custom and default applications. [Learn more.](https://docs.composio.dev)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Listing Default Triggers

<CodeGroup>
``` python Code for Get List of Triggers
from composio import Composio

composio_client = Composio("api-key")

print(composio_client.get_list_of_triggers())

```
</CodeGroup>

The response will include the trigger‚Äôs config/payload schema in a JSON compatible manner. It will also contain metadata like trigger name, ID.

## Setting Up Triggers

To set up triggers, follow these steps:

1. **Set Universal Callback URL**: Define a universal callback URL to receive payloads for all your triggers. You can set this URL through the settings on [app.composio.dev](http://app.composio.dev) or by using the API endpoint `api/v1/triggers/setCallbackURL`.

2. **Review Trigger Instructions**: Each trigger may have specific instructions. For example, in Slack, you need to configure our webhook URL in the OAuth app settings.

3. **Enable Trigger for Connected Account**: Use the trigger's configuration schema to enable the webhook URL for a specific connected account. This is done via the API endpoint `api/v1/triggers/enable/{connected_account_id}/{trigger_id}`. The request body should include `{"triggerConfig": {} }`, with all the necessary values as per the trigger's configuration schema. For example, for a GitHub repository webhook, the configuration might look like this:

<CodeGroup>
``` JSON API to get required trigger parameters
"triggerConfig": {
	  "owner": "kaavee315",
	  "repo": "ML_assignment"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Handling Triggers 

After completing the setup, the specified webhook URL will begin to receive data. 

This data includes the `connected_account_id` for account identification, `trigger_id` for trigger identification, and the `payload`, which adheres to the trigger's specified payload schema.
<CodeGroup>
``` JSON Sample Trigger Webhook, Received on Callback URL
{
	"trigger_id":"github_commit_event",
	"connected_account_id":"64184e1a-76bf-404b-bf8e-e9ce04fd7c9c",
	"payload":{
		"id":"ae4926ca23488ef488e76c8b39e2ad3ae9e58786",
		"message":"Update README.md",
		"timestamp":"2024-03-26T19:36:58+05:30",
		"author":"kaavee315",
		"url":"https://github.com/kaavee315/ML_assignment/commit/ae4926ca23488ef488e76c8b39e2ad3ae9e58786"
	}
}
