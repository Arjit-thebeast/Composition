## Connecting LangChain AI agents with Raven SEO Tools

### Overview of LangChain

LangChain is an AI framework useful for developing intelligent Agents powered by LLMs.

### Overview of Raven SEO Tools

Raven SEO Tools offers advanced SEO analysis, reporting, and data tracking services, enabling marketers and SEO professionals to enhance their online visibility and marketing strategies.

### Integrating Raven SEO Tools with LangChain

Integrating Raven SEO Tools & Langchain can allow for the following:

1. Advanced SEO analysis and reporting
2. Data tracking and performance metrics
& so many more

## Using LangChain with Raven SEO Tools

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up the Environment">

**Ideally this would require a lot of effort to set up** like authenticating, configuring, and setting up the Raven SEO Tools App, but we can use Composio using which it should be a breeze.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Installing & Authorising Raven SEO Tools
pip install composio_langchain # Install langchain, Composio 

composio-cli add ravenseotools # One line to authenticate, configure and add Raven SEO Tools integration for langchain
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Actions">
Composio ideally supports more than 100 different actions for any given app. If we supply all of them to langchain agents, 
the accuracy of the agent will be very low. So to get the highest accuracy, we need to filter the actions based on the 
use case.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Actions by Usecase
composio-cli get-actions ravenseotools "Advanced SEO analysis and reporting" --limit=10
```
</CodeGroup>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Base Packages">

<CodeGroup>
```python Initialise Imports
from langchain.agents import create_openai_functions_agent, AgentExecutor
from langchain import hub
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI


llm = ChatOpenAI()

prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch all Raven SEO Tools Langchain Actions via Composio">
<CodeGroup>
```python Tools For Raven SEO Tools
# Import from composio_langchain
from composio_langchain import ComposioToolset, Action, App

tools = ComposioToolset(actions=[]) # Copy the actions from above. 

# Get All the Actions for Raven SEO Tools
# tools = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ravenseotools]) # can use this as well
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Execute the Agent">
Create an agent, set up an executor, and invoke tasks to perform Raven SEO Tools API calls using Composio. 
<CodeGroup>
```python Langchain Agent executes the task

task = "Advanced SEO analysis and reporting"

agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

# Execute using agent_executor
agent_executor.invoke({"input": task})
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Check Response">
```bash Executing Agents
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

### Filter Specific Actions from Composio Toolset

<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific Action
# To restrict agents from using all the actions, filter specific actions
toolsGithubCreateIssue = ComposioToolset(actions=[Action.GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Use Specific Apps from Composio Toolset
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter Specific App
# To restrict agents from using all tools, filter specific tools
toolsAsanaGithub = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.ASANA, App.GITHUB])
```
</CodeGroup>

### Filter apps actions by tags 
<CodeGroup>
```bash Filter actions by tags
# To restrict agents from using all actions, filter the actions by tags
toolsAsanaGithub = ComposioToolset(apps=[App.NOTION], tags=[Tag.NOTION_BLOCK])
```
</CodeGroup>
